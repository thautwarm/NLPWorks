year 102 bc was a year of the pre-julian roman calendar. at the time it was known as the year of the consulship of marius and catulus (or, less frequently, year 652 ab urbe condita). the denomination 102 bc for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the anno domini calendar era became the prevalent method in europe for naming years.
