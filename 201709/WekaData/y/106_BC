year 106 bc was a year of the pre-julian roman calendar. at the time it was known as the year of the consulship of caepio and serranus (or, less frequently, year 648 ab urbe condita). the denomination 106 bc for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the anno domini calendar era became the prevalent method in europe for naming years.
