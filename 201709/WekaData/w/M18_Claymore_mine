the m18a1 claymore is a directional anti-personnel mine developed for the united states armed forces. its inventor, norman macleod, named the mine after a large scottish medieval sword. unlike a conventional land mine, the claymore is command-detonated and directional, meaning it is fired by remote-control and shoots a pattern of metal balls into the kill zone like a shotgun. the claymore fires steel balls, out to about 100 m (110 yd) within a 60Â° arc in front of the device. it is used primarily in ambushes and as an anti-infiltration device against enemy infantry. it is also used against unarmored vehicles. many countries have developed and use mines like the claymore. examples include former soviet union models mon-50, mon-90, mon-100, mon-200, and mrud (serbia), maped f1 (france), and mini ms-803 (south africa).
