in your house 12: it's time was the twelfth in your house professional wrestling pay-per-view event produced by the world wrestling federation (wwf) and presented by milton bradley's karate fighters. it took place on december 15, 1996, at the west palm beach auditorium in west palm beach, florida. the name of the show was taken from vader's catchphrase and indicated that he was originally scheduled to have a high profile on the show, but due to injuries was not on the show at all. the main event of the show was the first championship defense of newly crowned wwf world heavyweight champion sycho sid defending against former multi-time champion bret hart. the show featured six matches in the ppv portion, one match on the free for all preview show and two additional matches held before the cameras were turned on for the people in attendance in the arena. with the launch of the wwe network in 2014 this show became available on demand, but it did not include the two dark matches held after the main show or the free for all pre-show match.
