renal function, in nephrology, is an indication of the state of the kidney and its role in renal physiology. glomerular filtration rate (gfr) describes the flow rate of filtered fluid through the kidney. creatinine clearance rate (ccr or crcl) is the volume of blood plasma that is cleared of creatinine per unit time and is a useful measure for approximating the gfr. creatinine clearance exceeds gfr due to creatinine secretion, which can be blocked by cimetidine. in alternative fashion, overestimation by older serum creatinine methods resulted in an underestimation of creatinine clearance, which provided a less biased estimate of gfr. both gfr and ccr may be accurately calculated by comparative measurements of substances in the blood and urine, or estimated by formulas using just a blood test result (egfr and eccr). the results of these tests are used to assess the excretory function of the kidneys. staging of chronic kidney disease is based on categories of gfr as well as albuminuria and cause of kidney disease. dosage of drugs that are excreted primarily via urine may need to be modified based on either gfr or creatinine clearance.
