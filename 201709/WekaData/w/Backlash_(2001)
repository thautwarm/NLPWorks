backlash (2001) was a professional wrestling pay-per-view event produced by the world wrestling federation (wwf) promotion and presented by castrol gtx. it took place on april 29, 2001, at the allstate arena in rosemont, illinois, and was the third event under the backlash chronology. seven professional wrestling matches were scheduled on the event's card. the main event was a "winner take all" tag team match in which the reigning wwf champion stone cold steve austin teamed with his power trip ally, the reigning intercontinental champion triple h, to take on the reigning wwf tag team champions, the brothers of destruction (the undertaker and kane). the stipulations were that if austin and triple h won, they would become the new tag team champions. if undertaker and kane won, the wwf and intercontinental championships would be awarded to them based on who scored the winning fall. the power trip won the match after triple h hit kane with a sledgehammer, thus gaining control of the tag team championship and retaining their own titles. featured matches on the undercard included a last man standing match between shane mcmahon and the big show, which mcmahon won, and an ultimate submission match featuring chris benoit and kurt angle, which benoit won. backlash 2001 is also the last wwe pay-per-view event to feature the wwf intercontinental championship in the main event.
