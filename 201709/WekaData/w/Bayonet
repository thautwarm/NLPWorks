a bayonet (from french baïonnette) is a knife, sword, or spike-shaped weapon designed to fit in, on, over or underneath the muzzle of a rifle, musket or similar weapon, doubling the weapon as a spear. in this regard, it is an ancillary close-quarter combat or last-resort weapon. some modern bayonets, such as the one used on the british sa80 assault rifle, can be used as wire cutters when combined with their scabbards. knife-shaped bayonets—when not fixed to a gun barrel—have long been utilized by soldiers in the field as general purpose cutting implements.
