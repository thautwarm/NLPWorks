tasmanian wine is wine produced in the australian state of tasmania. located at a more southerly latitude than the rest of australia's wine regions, tasmania has a cooler climate and the potential to make distinctly different wines than in the rest of the country. the area grows primarily pinot noir, chardonnay and sauvignon blanc, with some smaller plantings of riesling, pinot gris and cabernet sauvignon. global warming has had positive effects on the tasmanian wine industry, allowing most of the grapes in the past few vintages (as of 2005) to ripen fully and produce more vibrant wine.
