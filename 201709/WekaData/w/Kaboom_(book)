kaboom: a soldier's war journal was a popular military blog from november 2007 to june 2008, before it was shut down by the writer's military chain-of-command. the author of the online journal, who went by the pseudonym of lt g, wrote about the front-line experiences in the iraq war as a united states army soldier. a scout platoon leader, lt g often incorporated the trials and tribulations of his platoon in his writings, offering a brash and brutally honest perspective of modern warfare. kaboom was shut down, and subsequently deleted, after lt g made a post detailing his turning down of a promotion in an effort to stay with his soldiers. before kaboom was shut down, it was one of the few military blogs to garner attention and press coverage from the print media. this can be attributed to lt g's literary writing style. in a nationally published story chronicling the rise and fall of kaboom, lt g was revealed to be matt gallagher, a young army officer who had been promoted to captain soon after his blog was shut down.
