the wikiwikiweb is the first ever wiki, or user-editable website. it was launched on 25 march 1995 by its inventor, programmer ward cunningham, to accompany the portland pattern repository website discussing software design patterns. the name wikiwikiweb originally also applied to the wiki software that operated the website, written in the perl programming language and later renamed to "wikibase". the site is frequently referred to by its users as simply "wiki", and a convention established among users of the early network of wiki sites that followed was that using the word with a capitalized w referred exclusively to the original site.
