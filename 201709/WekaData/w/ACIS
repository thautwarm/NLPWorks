the 3d acis modeler (acis) is a geometric modeling kernel developed by spatial corporation (formerly spatial technology), part of dassault systemes. acis is used by many software developers in industries such as computer-aided design (cad), computer-aided manufacturing (cam), computer-aided engineering (cae), architecture, engineering and construction (aec), coordinate-measuring machine (cmm), 3d animation, and shipbuilding. acis provides software developers and manufacturers the underlying 3d modeling functionality. acis features an open, object-oriented c++ architecture that enables robust, 3d modelling capabilities. acis is used to construct applications with hybrid modeling features, since it integrates wireframe model, surface, and solid modeling functionality with both manifold and non-manifold topology, and a rich set of geometric operations.
