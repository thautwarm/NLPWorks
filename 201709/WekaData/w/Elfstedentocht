the elfstedentocht (dutch pronunciation: [ɛlf'steːdə(n)tɔxt]; frisian: alvestêdetocht [ɑlvəˈstɛːdətɔxt], english: eleven cities tour) is a skating tour, almost 200 kilometres (120 mi) long, which is held both as a speed skating competition (with 300 contestants) and a leisure tour (with 16,000 skaters). it is held in the province of friesland in the north of the netherlands, leading past all eleven historical cities of the province. the tour is held at most once a year, only when the natural ice along the entire course is at least 15 centimetres (6 in) thick; sometimes on consecutive years, other times with gaps that may exceed 20 years. when the ice is suitable, the tour is announced and starts within 48 hours.
