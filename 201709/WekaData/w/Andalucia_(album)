andalucia is the fourth studio album by los angeles rock band tito & tarantula, released in 2002. the album marked several line-up changes in the band, which had previously consisted of lead singer/rhythm guitarist tito larriva, lead guitarist peter atanasoff, and drummer johnny "vatos" hernandez. this album featured the debut of lead guitarist steven hufsteter â€“ who had previously played with larriva in the cruzados, bassist io perry, and keyboardist marcus praed. the band toured promoting the album for several years. they also filmed a music video for the song "california girl". however, upon seeing how bad the footage of the video was, perry threw up, larriva threatened to quit, and atanasoff was not seen around for days. so, to compensate, larriva made his own video for the song using the eight dollars he had in his pocket. in the last 40 seconds of the song "effortless", larriva, atanasoff, and perry can be heard laughing while they watch the "california girl" music video. the song "la flor de mal" is a cover of a cruzados song that larriva and hufsteter wrote when they were in the cruzados.
