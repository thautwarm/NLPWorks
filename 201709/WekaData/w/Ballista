(for the roman general, see balista. for the italian actor, see gigi ballista. for the sniper rifle, see fn ballista.) the ballista (latin, from greek βαλλίστρα ballistra and that from βάλλω ballō, "throw"), plural ballistae, was an ancient missile weapon that launched a large projectile at a distant target. the earliest mention of ballista in literature occurs in the bible during the reign of uzziah around 783 – 742 bc, king in the kingdom of judah: "and he made in jerusalem engines, invented by cunning men, to be on the towers and upon the bulwarks, to shoot arrows and great stones withal. and his name spread far abroad; for he was marvellously helped, till he was strong." developed from earlier greek weapons, it relied upon different mechanics, using two levers with torsion springs instead of a prod (the bow part of a modern crossbow), the springs consisting of several loops of twisted skeins. early versions projected heavy darts or spherical stone projectiles of various sizes for siege warfare. it developed into a smaller precision weapon, the scorpio, and possibly the polybolos.
