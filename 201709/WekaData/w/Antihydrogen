antihydrogen is the antimatter counterpart of hydrogen. whereas the common hydrogen atom is composed of an electron and proton, the antihydrogen atom is made up of a positron and antiproton. antihydrogen has been produced artificially in particle accelerators, albeit at energies too high for detailed study. cern experiments created low energy antimatter and trapped atoms for precision studies. scientists hope studying antihydrogen may shed light on the baryon asymmetry problem or why there is more matter than antimatter in the universe. the standard symbol for antihydrogen is h.
