unesco designated the routes of santiago de compostela in france as a world heritage site in december 1998. the routes pass through the following regions of france: aquitaine, auvergne, basse-normandie, bourgogne, centre, champagne-ardenne, ile-de-france, languedoc-roussillon, limousin, midi-pyrénées, picardie, poitou-charentes, and provence-alpes-côte d'azur. unesco cites the routes' role in "religious and cultural exchange", the development of "specialized edifices" along the routes, and their "exceptional witness to the power and influence of christian faith among people of all classes and countries in europe during the middle ages". unesco identified 78 structures along the routes which, although not designated world heritage sites individually, were collectively designated under unesco's description of the routes to santiago in france. they are largely monuments, churches, or hospitals that provided services to pilgrims headed to santiago de compostela in spain. some are places of pilgrimage in their own right. other structures include a tower, a bridge, and a city gate.
