sūrat ash-shams (arabic: الشمس‎‎, "the sun") is the 91st sura of the qur'an with 15 ayat. it opens with a series of solemn oaths sworn on various astronomical phenomena, the first of which, "by the sun", gives the sura its name, then on the human soul itself. it then describes the fate of thamud, a formerly prosperous extinct arab tribe. the prophet saleh urged them to worship god alone, and commanded them in god's name to preserve a certain she-camel; they disobeyed and continued to reject his message, and god destroyed them all except those who had followed salih.
