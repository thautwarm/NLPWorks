jaws was a theme park attraction based upon the films of the same name. the attraction places guests aboard tour boats for what should be a leisurely tour of amity harbor, but instead becomes a harrowing chase between the craft and a very determined great white shark. jaws is an expanded version of a famous scene on the long-running backlot tour at universal studios hollywood, also inspired by the film, and can be found at universal studios japan near osaka, and formerly, at universal studios florida in orlando.
