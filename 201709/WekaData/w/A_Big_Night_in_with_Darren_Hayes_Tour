a big night in with darren hayes tour was the third tour undertaken by australian singer-songwriter darren hayes as a solo artist. the tour was undertaken to celebrate the release of savage garden's 10th anniversary greatest hits album. the staging for the tour was simple, with a 'living room' feel, featuring a bar, dining area and wardrobe. the show featured a great deal of audience participation, drawing on game shows, reality tv and internet dating. between songs, a male member of the audience was invited on to the stage where he was given a haircut and makeover by the tour's wardrobe staff. later, three women were invited on stage as potential 'dates', two being voted off by the audience via live text voting. the winner was then introduced to the made-over male and the pair were served a candle lit dinner on stage, whilst darren sang love ballads. at the end of the show, the woman was given the choice of either "taking the bloke" or winning geri halliwell's mobile phone number, or alternatively jason donovan's home phone number for australian performances, as a consolation prize. the musical side of the show featured the greatest number of savage garden songs that darren had performed since the demise of the group. this served as a kind of farewell to these songs, as he has rarely revisited them since this tour. during this tour he met keyboard player and producer justin shave, who has since gone on to become an ongoing musical collaborator with hayes. the dvd release of the tour, named a big night in with darren hayes, was recorded in the concert hall of the sydney opera house in sydney, australia in july 2006. the dvd was released in stores on 6 december 2006. it contains the entire live show, as well as various bonus materials.
