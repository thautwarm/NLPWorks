genomics is a discipline in genetics that applies recombinant dna, dna sequencing methods, and bioinformatics to sequence, assemble, and analyze the function and structure of genomes (the complete set of dna within a single cell of an organism). advances in genomics have triggered a revolution in discovery-based research to understand even the most complex biological systems such as the brain. the field includes efforts to determine the entire dna sequence of organisms and fine-scale genetic mapping. the field also includes studies of intragenomic phenomena such as heterosis, epistasis, pleiotropy and other interactions between loci and alleles within the genome. in contrast, the investigation of the roles and functions of single genes is a primary focus of molecular biology or genetics and is a common topic of modern medical and biological research. research of single genes does not fall into the definition of genomics unless the aim of this genetic, pathway, and functional information analysis is to elucidate its effect on, place in, and response to the entire genomes networks.
