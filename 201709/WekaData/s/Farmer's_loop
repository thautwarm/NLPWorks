the farmer's loop is a knot which forms a fixed loop. as a midline loop knot made with a bight, it is related to several other similar knots, including the alpine butterfly knot and artillery loop. if pulled from one end and that ends continuation into the loop while not tightened it may capsize to a slip knot with a complicated and heavy knot. it is tied on one hand to make a loop about twice the size of that hand (use fingers for a smaller one, thumb-hook-to-elbow for a large one), as follows: 1.  
*  start with the rope 3 times around the palm of one hand, let the ends hang down,  2.  
*  then pull the initial middle turn up from the top edge and place it over to the right  3.  
*  then pull the now new middle turn up from the top edge and place it over to the left  4.  
*  then pull the now new middle turn up from the top edge and place it over to the right 5.  
*  then pull the now new middle turn up to form the loop, dress and tighten before use
