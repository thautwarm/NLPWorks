the figure-eight knot or figure-of-eight knot is a type of stopper knot. it is very important in both sailing and rock climbing as a method of stopping ropes from running out of retaining devices. like the overhand knot, which will jam under strain, often requiring the rope to be cut, the figure-of-eight will also jam, but is usually more easily undone than the overhand knot.
