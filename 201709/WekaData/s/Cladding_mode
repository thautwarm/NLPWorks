in fiber optics, a cladding mode is a mode that is confined to the cladding of an optical fiber by virtue of the fact that the cladding has a higher refractive index than the surrounding medium, which is either air or the primary polymer overcoat. these modes are generally undesired. modern fibers have a primary polymer overcoat with a refractive index that is slightly higher than that of the cladding, so that light propagating in the cladding is rapidly attenuated and disappears after only a few centimeters of propagation. an exception to this is double-clad fiber, which is designed to support a mode in its inner cladding, as well as one in its core.  this article incorporates public domain material from the general services administration document "federal standard 1037c".
