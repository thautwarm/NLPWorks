the emirates cup is a pre-season association football invitational competition hosted by english club arsenal at their home ground emirates stadium, in holloway, london. the two-day competition was inaugurated in 2007, and is named after arsenal's main sponsor emirates. it has been held every summer except 2012 due to the london olympics, and 2016 because of pitch renovation work. the competition follows a point scoring system much like the amsterdam tournament, whereby each team plays two matches, with three points awarded for a win, one point for a draw and none for a loss. an additional point is awarded for every goal scored; this was scrapped in 2011, but made a return from the 2013 edition. from 2009, total shots on target throughout the tournament has been used as a tiebreaker if teams are tied on points, goal difference and goals scored. arsenal won the inaugural tournament in 2007, and further wins followed in 2009, 2010, and most recently 2015. four other sides have won the emirates cup: hamburg in 2008, new york red bulls in 2011, galatasaray in 2013 and valencia in 2014. paris saint-germain are the most regular guests, having been invited to compete in the tournament on three occasions; they have finished as runners-up twice. four italian clubs (inter, juventus, milan and napoli) have appeared in the tournament, more than any other nation.
