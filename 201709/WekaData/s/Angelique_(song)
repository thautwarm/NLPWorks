"angelique" was the danish entry in the eurovision song contest 1961, performed in danish by dario campeotto. the song was performed thirteenth on the night, following norway's nora brockstedt with "sommer i palma" and preceding luxembourg's jean-claude pascal with "nous les amoureux". at the close of voting, it had received 12 points, placing 5th in a field of 16. the song is a love ballad directed towards the title character, with campeotto singing about the various things he would do for her if he had the skill - such as writing poetry if he were william shakespeare or playing the violin if he were yehudi menuhin. he explains, however, that "the muses said no" to his attempts to master the arts (including singing, unusually for a professional singer), so he is simply dreaming about her. it was succeeded as danish representative at the 1962 contest by ellen winther with "vuggevise".
