data integrity is the maintenance of, and the assurance of the accuracy and consistency of, data over its entire life-cycle, and is a critical aspect to the design, implementation and usage of any system which stores, processes, or retrieves data. the term data integrity is broad in scope and may have widely different meanings depending on the specific context â€“ even under the same general umbrella of computing. this article provides only a broad overview of some of the different types and concerns of data integrity. data integrity is the opposite of data corruption, which is a form of data loss. the overall intent of any data integrity technique is the same: ensure data is recorded exactly as intended (such as a database correctly rejecting mutually exclusive possibilities,) and upon later retrieval, ensure the data is the same as it was when it was originally recorded. in short, data integrity aims to prevent unintentional changes to information. data integrity is not to be confused with data security, the discipline of protecting data from unauthorized parties. any unintended changes to data as the result of a storage, retrieval or processing operation, including malicious intent, unexpected hardware failure, and human error, is failure of data integrity. if the changes are the result of unauthorized access, it may also be a failure of data security. depending on the data involved this could manifest itself as benign as a single pixel in an image appearing a different color than was originally recorded, to the loss of vacation pictures or a business-critical database, to even catastrophic loss of human life in a life-critical system.
