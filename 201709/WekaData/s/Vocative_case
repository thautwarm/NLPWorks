the vocative case (abbreviated voc, voc.) is the case used for a noun that identifies a person (animal, object, etc.) being addressed or, occasionally, the determiners of that noun. a vocative expression is an expression of direct address where the identity of the party spoken to is set forth expressly within a sentence. for example, in the sentence, "i don't know, john", john is a vocative expression that indicates the party being addressedâ€”as opposed to the sentence, "i don't know john", where john is the direct object of the verb "know." historically, the vocative case was an element of the indo-european system of cases, and existed in latin, sanskrit, and classical greek. many modern indo-european languages have lost the vocative case. many, however, retain it, including the baltic languages and most slavic languages. some linguists argue that the vocative form is not a case but a special form of nouns not belonging to any case, since vocative expressions are not related syntactically to other words in sentences.
