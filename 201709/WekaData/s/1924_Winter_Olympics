the 1924 winter olympics, officially known as the i olympic winter games (french: les iers jeux olympiques d'hiver), were a winter multi-sport event which was held in 1924 in chamonix, france. originally called semaine internationale des sports d'hiver ("international winter sports week") and held in association with the 1924 summer olympics, the sports competitions were held at the foot of mont blanc in chamonix, and haute-savoie, france between january 25 and february 5, 1924. the games were organized by the french olympic committee, and were in retrospect designated by the international olympic committee (ioc) as the i olympic winter games. the tradition of holding the winter olympics in the same year as the summer olympics would continue until 1992, after which the current practice of holding a winter olympics in the second year after each summer olympics began. although figure skating had been an olympic event in both london and antwerp, and ice hockey had been an event in antwerp, the winter sports had always been limited by the season. in 1921, at the convention of the ioc in lausanne, there was a call for equality for winter sports, and after much discussion it was decided to organize an "international week of winter sport" in 1924 in chamonix.
