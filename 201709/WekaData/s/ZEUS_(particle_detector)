zeus was a particle detector that operated on the hera (hadron elektron ring anlage) particle accelerator at desy, hamburg. it began running together with hera in 1992 and was functional until hera was decommissioned in june 2007. the scientific collaboration behind zeus consisted of about 400 physicists from 56 institutes in 17 countries. the zeus detector comprised many components, including a depleted uranium plastic-scintillator calorimeter, a central tracking detector (which is a wire chamber), a silicon microvertex detector and muon chambers. in addition, a solenoid provides a 1.43 t magnetic field. the zeus experiment studied the internal structure of the proton through measurements of deep inelastic scattering by colliding leptons (electrons or positrons) with proton in the interaction point of zeus. these measurements were also used to test and study the standard model of particle physics, as well as searching for particles beyond the standard model.
