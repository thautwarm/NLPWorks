tax freedom day is the first day of the year in which a nation as a whole has theoretically earned enough income to pay its taxes. every dollar that is officially considered income by the government is counted, and every payment to the government that is officially considered a tax is counted. taxes at all levels of government – local, state and federal – are included.
