ascomycota is a division or phylum of the kingdom fungi that, together with the basidiomycota, form the subkingdom dikarya. its members are commonly known as the sac fungi or ascomycetes. they are the largest phylum of fungi, with over 64,000 species. the defining feature of this fungal group is the "ascus" (from greek: ἀσκός (askos), meaning "sac" or "wineskin"), a microscopic sexual structure in which nonmotile spores, called ascospores, are formed. however, some species of the ascomycota are asexual, meaning that they do not have a sexual cycle and thus do not form asci or ascospores. previously placed in the deuteromycota along with asexual species from other fungal taxa, asexual (or anamorphic) ascomycetes are now identified and classified based on morphological or physiological similarities to ascus-bearing taxa, and by phylogenetic analyses of dna sequences. the ascomycetes are a monophyletic group, i.e. it contains all descendants of one common ancestor. this group is of particular relevance to humans as sources for medicinally important compounds, such as antibiotics and for making bread, alcoholic beverages, and cheese, but also as pathogens of humans and plants. familiar examples of sac fungi include morels, truffles, brewer's yeast and baker's yeast, dead man's fingers, and cup fungi. the fungal symbionts in the majority of lichens (loosely termed "ascolichens") such as cladonia belong to the ascomycota. there are many plant-pathogenic ascomycetes, including apple scab, rice blast, the ergot fungi, black knot, and the powdery mildews. several species of ascomycetes are biological model organisms in laboratory research. most famously, neurospora crassa, several species of yeasts, and aspergillus species are used in many genetics and cell biology studies. penicillium species on cheeses and those producing antibiotics for treating bacterial infectious diseases are examples of taxa that belong to the ascomycota.
