"pretty little ditty" is an instrumental track by the american funk/alternative rock band red hot chili peppers, from their 1989 album mother's milk. recognized as one of the best examples of the eclecticism the band experimented with in this album, the song was written by guitarist john frusciante and bassist flea. it is one of the few songs on the album not to feature any guitar layering; music journalist jeff apter defined the song "a dreamy, sweetly stoned instrumental featured deft picking and strumming from frusciante, intertwined with blasts of trumpet from flea".
