beonex communicator is a discontinued open-source internet suite based on the mozilla application suite (mas) by ben bucksch, a german mozilla developer. it was intended to have a higher security and privacy level than other commercial products. the internet suite contains a web browser, an email and news client, an html editor (based on mozilla composer) and an irc client (based on chatzilla). beonex business services offered the suite for free and provided documentation, easy install routines for third-party plug-ins, and tried to sell support and customer-specific changes on the browser. the main goal was to implement kerberos, openpgp, and ldap in beonex, but that was marked as failed in mid-2004. it was discontinued before reaching production release stage.
