an electromagnetic pulse (commonly abbreviated as emp, pronounced /iː.ɛm.piː/) is a burst of electromagnetic radiation. nuclear explosions create a characteristic pulse of electromagnetic radiation called a nuclear emp or nemp. the resulting rapidly changing electric and magnetic fields may couple with electrical and electronic systems to produce damaging current and voltage surges. the specific characteristics of any particular nuclear emp event vary according to a number of factors, the most important of which is the altitude of the detonation. the term "electromagnetic pulse" generally excludes optical (infrared, visible, ultraviolet) and ionizing (such as x-ray and gamma radiation) ranges. in military terminology, a nuclear warhead detonated hundreds of kilometers above the earth's surface is known as a high-altitude electromagnetic pulse (hemp) device. effects of a hemp device depend on factors including the altitude of the detonation, energy yield, gamma ray output, interactions with the earth's magnetic field and electromagnetic shielding of targets.
