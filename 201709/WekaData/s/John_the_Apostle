john the apostle (aramaic: ܝܘܚܢܢ ܫܠܝܚܐ‎‎ yohanan shliha; hebrew: יוחנן בן זבדי‎‎ yohanan ben zavdi; koine greek: ἰωάννης; latin: ioannes; c. ad 6-100) was one of the twelve apostles of jesus according to the new testament. he was the son of zebedee and salome. his brother was james, who was another of the twelve apostles. christian tradition holds that he outlived the remaining apostles and that he was the only one not to die a martyr's death (excluding judas iscariot who died by suicide). the church fathers considered him the same person as john the evangelist, john of patmos, john the elder and the beloved disciple, although modern theologians and scholars have not formed a consensus on the relative identities of these men. the traditions of most christian denominations hold that john the apostle is the author of several books of the new testament.
