the chatti (also chatthi or catti) were an ancient germanic tribe whose homeland was near the upper weser. they lived in central and northern hesse and southern lower saxony, along the upper reaches of the weser river and in the valleys and mountains of the eder, fulda, and weser river regions, a district approximately corresponding to hesse-kassel, though probably somewhat more extensive. they settled within the region in the first century b.c. according to tacitus, the batavians of his time were descended from a part of the chatti, who left their homeland after an internal quarrel drove them out, to take up new lands at the mouth of the rhine.
