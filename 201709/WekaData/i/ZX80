the sinclair zx80 is a home computer brought to market in 1980 by science of cambridge ltd. (later to be better known as sinclair research). it is notable for being the first computer (unless one counts the mk14) available in the united kingdom for less than a hundred pounds. it was available in kit form for £79.95, where purchasers had to assemble and solder it together, and as a ready-built version at £99.95. the zx80 was very popular straight away, and for some time there was a waiting list of several months for either version of the machine.
