single instruction, multiple data (simd), is a class of parallel computers in flynn's taxonomy. it describes computers with multiple processing elements that perform the same operation on multiple data points simultaneously. thus, such machines exploit data level parallelism, but not concurrency: there are simultaneous (parallel) computations, but only a single process (instruction) at a given moment. simd is particularly applicable to common tasks like adjusting the contrast in a digital image or adjusting the volume of digital audio. most modern cpu designs include simd instructions in order to improve the performance of multimedia use.
