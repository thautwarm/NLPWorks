("uri" redirects here. for other uses, see uri (disambiguation).) in information technology, a uniform resource identifier (uri) is a string of characters used to identify a resource. such identification enables interaction with representations of the resource over a network, typically the world wide web, using specific protocols. schemes specifying a concrete syntax and associated protocols define each uri. the most common form of uri is the uniform resource locator (url), frequently referred to informally as a web address. more rarely seen in usage is the uniform resource name (urn), which was designed to complement urls by providing a mechanism for the identification of resources in particular namespaces.
