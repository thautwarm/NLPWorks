deep blue was a chess-playing computer developed by ibm. it is known for being the first computer chess-playing system to win both a chess game and a chess match against a reigning world champion under regular time controls. deep blue won its first game against a world champion on february 10, 1996, when it defeated garry kasparov in game one of a six-game match. however, kasparov won three and drew two of the following five games, defeating deep blue by a score of 4–2. deep blue was then heavily upgraded, and played kasparov again in may 1997. deep blue won game six, therefore winning the six-game rematch 3½–2½ and becoming the first computer system to defeat a reigning world champion in a match under standard chess tournament time controls. kasparov accused ibm of cheating and demanded a rematch. ibm refused and retired deep blue. development for deep blue began in 1985 with the chiptest project at carnegie mellon university. this project eventually evolved into deep thought, at which point the development team was hired by ibm. the project evolved once more with the new name deep blue in 1989. grandmaster joel benjamin was also signed on to the development team by ibm.
