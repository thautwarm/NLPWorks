mantophasmatidae  is a family of carnivorous insects within the order notoptera, which was discovered in africa in 2001. originally, the group was regarded as an order in its own right, and named mantophasmatodea, but based on recent evidence indicating a sister group relationship with grylloblattidae (formerly classified in the order grylloblattodea), arillo & engel have combined the two groups into a single order, notoptera.
