in mathematics, specifically in ring theory, the simple modules over a ring r are the (left or right) modules over r that have no non-zero proper submodules. equivalently, a module m is simple if and only if every cyclic submodule generated by a non-zero element of m equals m. simple modules form building blocks for the modules of finite length, and they are analogous to the simple groups in group theory. in this article, all modules will be assumed to be right unital modules over a ring r.
