in telecommunication, a narrowband modem is a modem whose modulated output signal has an essential frequency spectrum that is limited to that which can be wholly contained within, and faithfully transmitted through, a voice channel with a nominal 4 khz bandwidth. note: high frequency (hf) modems are limited to operation over a voice channel with a nominal 3 khz bandwidth.
