a flattop grill is a cooking appliance that resembles a griddle but performs differently because the heating element is circular rather than straight (side to side). this heating technology creates an extremely hot and even cooking surface, as heat spreads in a radial fashion over the surface. flattop grills have been around for hundreds of years in various forms and evolved in a number of cultures.
