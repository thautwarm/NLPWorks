the nzihl is new zealandâ€™s national ice hockey league. it is an amateur league that was formed in 2005 to develop the sport in new zealand and to give the top players regular competition against each other to improve the skill level of the game domestically and make new zealand more competitive on the international scene. because the nzihl is held during the northern hemisphere's ice hockey offseason, many quality players travel to new zealand and enjoy an off-season abroad while keeping in ice hockey shape. the competition is comparable to north america's lowest professional levels, impressive for a southern hemisphere country in the sport of ice hockey. the new zealand ice hockey federation is made up of 3 affiliated regions, all of whom are represented in the new zealand ice hockey league with 2 teams from auckland, 2 teams from southern and 1 team from canterbury.
