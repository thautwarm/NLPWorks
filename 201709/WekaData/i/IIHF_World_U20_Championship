the iihf ice hockey world junior championships (wjc), commonly known simply as the world juniors, is an annual event organized by the international ice hockey federation (iihf) for national under-20 ice hockey teams from around the world. it is traditionally held in late december, ending in the beginning of january. the main tournament features the top ten ranked hockey nations in the world, comprising the 'top division', from which a world champion is crowned. there are also three lower pools—divisions i, ii and iii—that each play separate tournaments playing for the right to be promoted to a higher pool, or face relegation to a lower pool. the competition's profile is particularly high in canada; its stature has been credited to canada's strong performance in the tournament (it has won the gold medal sixteen times since its inception), the role of hockey in canadian culture, along with strong media coverage and fan attendance. as such, in recent years, nearly half of the tournaments have been held in canadian cities, with the remainder being held in europe and the united states. finland is the defending champion of the tournament, after having beaten russia to win the 2016 edition.
