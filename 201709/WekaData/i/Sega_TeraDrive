the teradrive (テラドライブ teradoraibu) is an ibm pc compatible system with an integrated mega drive, developed by sega and manufactured by ibm in 1991. the teradrive allowed for mega drive games to be played the same time as the pc section is being used, as it is possible for the mega drive and pc hardware to interact with each other. the system was only released in japan, as sega was hopeful that by integrating its then popular mega drive console into an ibm pc would be an attraction for potential customers wishing to purchase a pc. the system however proved unpopular with the japanese market and ultimately failed.
