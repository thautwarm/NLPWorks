cichlids /ˈsɪklᵻdz/ are fish from the family cichlidae in the order perciformes. cichlids are members of a suborder known as labroidei, along with the wrasses (labridae), damselfishes (pomacentridae), and surfperches (embiotocidae). this family is both large and diverse. at least 1,650 species have been scientifically described, making it one of the largest vertebrate families. new species are discovered almost annually, and many species remain undescribed. the actual number of species is therefore unknown, with estimates varying between 2,000 and 3,000. cichlids are also popular freshwater fish kept in the home aquarium.
