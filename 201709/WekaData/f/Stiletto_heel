a stiletto heel is a long, thin, high heel found on some boots and shoes, usually for women. it is named after the stiletto dagger, the phrase being first recorded in the early 1930s. stiletto heels may vary in length from 2.5 centimetres (1 inch) to 25 cm (10 inches) or more if a platform sole is used, and are sometimes defined as having a diameter at the ground of less than 1 cm (slightly less than half an inch). stiletto-style heels 5 cm (2.0 in) or shorter are called kitten heels. not all high slim heels merit the description stiletto. the extremely slender original italian-style stiletto heels of the late 1950s and very early 1960s were no more than 5 mm (0.20 in) in diameter for much of their length, although the heel sometimes flared out a little at the top-piece (tip). after their demise in the mid-late 1960s, such slender heels were difficult to find until recently due to changes in the way heels were mass-produced. a real stiletto heel has a stem of solid steel or alloy. the more usual method of mass-producing high shoe heels, i.e. moulded plastic with an internal metal tube for reinforcement, does not achieve the true stiletto shape.
