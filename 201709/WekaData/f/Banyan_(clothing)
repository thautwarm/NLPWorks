a banyan (through portuguese banian and arabic بنيان, banyān, from the gujarati વાણિયો, vāṇiyo, meaning "merchant") is a garment worn by men in the 18th century influenced by persian and asian clothing. banyan is also commonly used in present day indian english and other countries in the indian subcontinent to mean "vest" ("undershirt" in american english). also called a morning gown, robe de chambre or nightgown, the banyan was a loose, t-shaped or kimono-like cotton, linen, or silk gown worn at home as a sort of dressing gown or informal coat over the shirt and breeches. the typical banyan was cut en chemise, with the sleeves and body cut as one piece. it was usually paired with a soft, turban-like cap worn in place of the formal periwig. an alternative style of banyan was cut like a coat, fitted, with set-in sleeves, and was closed with buttons and buttonholes.
