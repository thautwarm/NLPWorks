a bail (also spelled "bale") is a component of certain types of jewelry, mostly necklaces, that is used to attach a pendant or stone. the bail is normally placed in the center of the necklace where the pendant hangs. some bails are made so a pendant can be attached after the necklace production is completed. this way, a necklace design can be mass-produced for multiple companies and the pendants can be attached after the necklaces are shipped to them. a classic bail allows the chain to pass through and is connected by a ring to the pendant. bails are a frequently pre-made component used on an otherwise handmade piece of jewelry.
