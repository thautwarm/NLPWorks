castalia (/kəˈsteɪliə/; greek: κασταλία), in greek mythology, was a nymph whom apollo transformed into a fountain at delphi, at the base of mount parnassos, or at mount helicon. castalia could inspire the genius of poetry to those who drank her waters or listened to their quiet sound; the sacred water was also used to clean the delphian temples. apollo consecrated castalia to the muses (castaliae musae). the 20th century german writer hermann hesse used castalia as inspiration for the name of the futuristic fictional utopia in his 1943 magnum opus, the glass bead game. castalia is home to an austere order of intellectuals with a twofold mission: to run boarding schools for boys, and to nurture and play the glass bead game.
