the 2009–10 football league cup, known as the carling cup due to the competition's sponsorship by lager brand carling, was the 50th season of the football league cup, a knock-out competition for england's top 92 football clubs. manchester united successfully defended their football league cup title after defeating aston villa by 2–1 in the final at wembley stadium on 28 february 2010. each season, the league cup winners – like the winners of the fa cup – are granted a place in the uefa europa league for the following season. however, in cases where a team has already gained a place in european competition via their league position or progress in other cup competitions, their place in the europa league is deferred to the next-placed league side. in this season, since manchester united and fa cup winners chelsea qualified for the uefa champions league via the premier league, aston villa and liverpool qualified for the europa league as the sixth- and seventh-placed sides in the league.
