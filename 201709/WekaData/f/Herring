herring are forage fish, mostly belonging to the family clupeidae. herring often move in large schools around fishing banks and near the coast. the most abundant and commercially important species belong to the genus clupea, found particularly in shallow, temperate waters of the north pacific and the north atlantic oceans, including the baltic sea, as well as off the west coast of south america. three species of clupea are recognised, and provide about 90% of all herrings captured in fisheries. most abundant of all is the atlantic herring, providing over half of all herring capture. fishes called herring are also found in india, in the arabian sea, indian ocean and bay of bengal. herring played a pivotal role in the history of marine fisheries in europe, and early in the twentieth century their study was fundamental to the evolution of fisheries science. these oily fish also have a long history as an important food fish, and are often salted, smoked, or pickled.
