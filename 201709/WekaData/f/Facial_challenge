in u.s. constitutional law, a facial challenge is a challenge to a statute in which the plaintiff alleges that the legislation is always unconstitutional, and therefore void. it is contrasted with an as-applied challenge, which alleges that a particular application of a statute is unconstitutional. if a facial challenge is successful, a court will declare the statute in question facially invalid, which has the effect of striking it down entirely. this contrasts with a successful as-applied challenge, which will result in a court narrowing the circumstances in which the statute may constitutionally be applied without striking it down. in some casesâ€”e.g., gonzales v. carhart or crawford v. marion county election board, a facial challenge has been rejected with either the court or concurring justices intimating that the upheld statute might be vulnerable to an as-applied challenge. in first amendment cases, another type of facial challenge is enunciated in the overbreadth doctrine. if a statute reaches to include substantially protected conduct and speech in relation to the legitimate reach of the statute, then it is overbroad and thus void on its face.
