the money in the bank ladder match (sometimes abbreviated as mitb) is a ladder match held by the professional wrestling promotion wwe. at first contested at wrestlemania, a separate money in the bank pay-per-view was established. the prize in the match is a briefcase containing a contract for a world championship match, which can be "cashed in" by the holder of the briefcase at any point in the year following his victory. the match was first contested in 2005 at wrestlemania 21, after being invented by chris jericho, and was then exclusive to raw superstars, with edge winning the first briefcase. from 2005 to 2010, the mitb match, now open to all wwe brands, became a wrestlemania mainstay. 2010 saw a second and third money in the bank ladder matches when the money in the bank pay-per-view debuted in july. unlike the matches at wrestlemania, this new event featured two such ladder matches â€“ one each for a contract for the wwe world championship and world heavyweight championship, respectively. before the establishment of the annual money in the bank pay-per-view, wrestlers were allowed to use the contract to claim a match for any world championship in wwe. after the establishment of the pay-per-view, the money in the bank contracts were specifically aimed at one or the other championship. with the unification of the wwe and world heavyweight titles into the wwe world heavyweight championship in december 2013, there is now only a single briefcase/contract in play. this went into effect beginning at the 2014 money in the bank ppv.
