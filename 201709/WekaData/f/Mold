a mold |us /or mould (uk / nz / au / za / in / ca) is a fungus that grows in the form of multicellular filaments called hyphae. in contrast, fungi that can adopt a single-celled growth habit are called yeasts. molds are a large and taxonomically diverse number of fungal species where the growth of hyphae results in discoloration and a fuzzy appearance, especially on food. the network of these tubular branching hyphae, called a mycelium, is considered a single organism. the hyphae are generally transparent, so the mycelium appears like very fine, fluffy white threads over the surface. cross-walls (septa) may delimit connected compartments along the hyphae, each containing one or multiple, genetically identical nuclei. the dusty texture of many molds is caused by profuse production of asexual spores (conidia) formed by differentiation at the ends of hyphae. the mode of formation and shape of these spores is traditionally used to classify molds. many of these spores are colored, making the fungus much more obvious to the human eye at this stage in its life-cycle. molds are considered to be microbes and do not form a specific taxonomic or phylogenetic grouping, but can be found in the divisions zygomycota and ascomycota. in the past, most molds were classified within the deuteromycota. molds cause biodegradation of natural materials, which can be unwanted when it becomes food spoilage or damage to property. they also play important roles in biotechnology and food science in the production of various foods, beverages, antibiotics, pharmaceuticals and enzymes. some diseases of animals and humans can be caused by certain molds: disease may result from allergic sensitivity to mold spores, from growth of pathogenic molds within the body, or from the effects of ingested or inhaled toxic compounds (mycotoxins) produced by molds.
