coprinopsis lagopus is a species of fungus in the family psathyrellaceae. until 2001, the species was known as coprinus lagopus; advances in the understanding of phylogenetic relationships between the various coprinoid species led to a major reorganization of that genus. it is a delicate and short-lived fungus, the fruit bodies lasting only a few hours before dissolving into a black ink â€“ a process called deliquescence. the vague resemblance of the young fruit body to the paw of a white rabbit has earned this species the common name harefoot mushroom.
