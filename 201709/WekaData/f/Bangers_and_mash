bangers and mash, also known as sausages and mash, is a traditional british isles dish made of mashed potatoes and sausages, the latter of which may consist of a variety of flavoured sausage made of pork or beef or a cumberland sausage. it is sometimes served with onion gravy, fried onions, baked beans, or peas. it is mostly eaten in the united kingdom, canada, australia, and new zealand. this dish, even when cooked at home, may be thought of as an example of pub grubâ€”relatively quick and easy to make in large quantities. more up-market varieties, with exotic sausages and mashes, are sold in gastropubs, as well as less sophisticated alternatives being available in regular public houses.
