a makarapa is a hand-cut and hand-painted hard hat worn by sports fans. they belong to the typical south african football fan's supporters gear, and are increasingly popular with fans of other sports. sport fans spend hours to sculpt and paint their makarapa in the colours and emblem of their clubs or country. besides the makarapa, fans also wear giant glasses or have shields with team slogans and logos. it is generally accepted that alfred "lux" baloyi is the originator of the makarapa as a fan gear or tool as it is known today, and is the owner of the 'original baloyi makarapa' trademark. many makarapa artists in south africa make a modest living from designing makarapa, selling them to sports fans of all kinds. with the 2010 fifa world cup, the international profile and availability of the makarapa has increased greatly.
