aten (also aton, egyptian jtn) is the disk of the sun in ancient egyptian mythology, and originally an aspect of the god ra. the deified aten is the focus of the religion of atenism established by amenhotep iv, who later took the name akhenaten (died ca. 1335 bce) in worship and recognition of aten. in his poem "great hymn to the aten", akhenaten praises aten as the creator, giver of life, and nurturing spirit of the world. aten does not have a creation myth or family, but is mentioned in the book of the dead. the worship of aten was eradicated by horemheb.
