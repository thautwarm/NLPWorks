survivor: marquesas is the fourth season of the american cbs competitive reality television series survivor. the season filmed from november 12, 2001 through december 20, 2001 and premiered on february 28, 2002. hosted by jeff probst, it consisted of the usual 39 days of gameplay with 16 competitors. the marquesas islands were initially selected as a backup location for survivor. the original location, jordan, was discounted as a result of the september 11 attacks and the political situation in the middle east. the contestants were divided into two tribes: maraamu and rotu (marquesan for 'wind' and 'rain', respectively). they later merged into the soliantu tribe (a word created by competitors kathy-vavrick o'brien and "boston rob" mariano which they intended to mean "sacred allegiance to the sun"). the winner, vecepia towery, was named sole survivor after defeating runner-up neleh dennis by a jury vote of 4-3. this was the first season where the contestants were not given any initial supplies, such as food, water, or matches. also, the rules of individual immunity were changed so that a contestant who won immunity in a challenge was able to give it to another contestant. a new tiebreaker format was developed in preference of the past-used tiebreaker involving previous votes cast. the controversial new purple rock tiebreaker was used, resulting in the ousting of paschal english, then with no votes against him. a small increase in the average number of viewers was observed for the season compared to the prior season, survivor: africa. the complete season, including the mid-season recap episode and live reunion show, was released on dvd on october 5, 2010. it was initially released in a 9-disc package, but was later reissued condensed into 5 discs.
