the presidential archives and leadership library (formerly, the presidential museum) is a museum and library complex located at 4919 east university blvd. in odessa, texas, on the campus of the university of texas of the permian basin. unlike the many presidential libraries, the museum is dedicated to the office of the president of the united states, rather than any individual who has held the position. the museum-library was originally located in downtown odessa, but under legislation authored in 1999 by the late state representative george e. "buddy" west of odessa and signed into law by then governor george w. bush, the museum moved into a new building adjacent to the ellen noel art museum on the utpb campus.
