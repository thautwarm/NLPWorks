galagos /ɡəˈleɪɡoʊz/, also known as bushbabies, bush babies, or nagapies (meaning "little night monkeys" in afrikaans), are small, nocturnal primates native to continental africa, and make up the family galagidae (also sometimes called galagonidae). they are sometimes included as a subfamily within the lorisidae or loridae. according to some accounts, the name "bushbaby" comes from either the animal's cries or its appearance. the south african name nagapie is because they are almost exclusively seen at night, while the ghanaian name " aposor" is given to them because of their firm grip on branches. in both variety and abundance, the bushbabies are the most successful primitive primates in africa, according to the african wildlife foundation.
