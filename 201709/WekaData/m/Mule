a mule is the offspring of a male donkey (jack) and a female horse (mare). horses and donkeys are different species, with different numbers of chromosomes. of the two f1 hybrids between these two species, a mule is easier to obtain than a hinny, which is the offspring of a female donkey (jenny) and a male horse (stallion). the size of a mule and work to which it is put depend largely on the breeding of the mule's female parent (dam). mules can be lightweight, medium weight, or when produced from draft horse mares, of moderately heavy weight. mules are more patient, hardy and long-lived than horses, and are less obstinate and more intelligent than donkeys.
