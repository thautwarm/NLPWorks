a remotely guided rat, popularly called a ratbot or robo-rat, is a rat with electrodes implanted in the medial forebrain bundle (mfb) and sensorimotor cortex of its brain. they were developed in 2002 by sanjiv talwar and john chapin at the state university of new york downstate medical center. the rats wear a small electronics backpack containing a radio receiver and electrical stimulator. the rat receives remote stimulation in the sensorimotor cortex via its backpack that causes the rat to feel a sensation in its left or right whiskers, and stimulation in the mfb that is interpreted as a reward or pleasure. after a period of training and conditioning using mfb stimulation as a reward, the rats can be remotely directed to move left, right, and forward in response to whisker stimulation signals. it is possible to roughly guide the animal along an obstacle course, jumping small gaps and scaling obstacles.
