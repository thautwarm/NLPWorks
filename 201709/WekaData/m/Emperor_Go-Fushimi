emperor go-fushimi (後伏見天皇 go-fushimi-tennō, 5 april 1288 – 17 may 1336) was the 93rd emperor of japan, according to the traditional order of succession. his reign spanned the years from 1298 to 1301. this 13th-century sovereign was named after his father, emperor fushimi and go- (後), translates literally as "later"; and thus, he is sometimes called the "later emperor fushimi". the japanese word go has also been translated to mean the "second one;" and in some older sources, this emperor may be identified as "fushimi, the second," or as "fushimi ii."
