joe pullen (c. 1883 - december 15, 1923) was an african-american tenant farmer who was murdered by a lynch mob of local white citizens near drew, mississippi on december 15, 1923. while the circumstances that precipitated the violence were typical for that place and time, pullen's case is unusual in that he managed to kill at least three members of the lynch mob and wound several others before ultimately perishing himself. because of his courage, pullen became a folk hero and his bravery was championed by the universal negro improvement association. while the incident received only brief national news coverage, the local repercussions were far more profound. as civil rights leader fanny lou hamer recalled in an autobiographical essay on growing up in a nearby mississippi town: "it was a while in mississippi before the whites tried something like that again."
