the new sweden farmstead museum is an open-air museum in bridgeton, new jersey, united states. the museum is a recreation of a 17th-century swedish farmstead located in city park and is a historical remembrance of the history of the swedish and finnish people in early america who first arrived as part of the colony of new sweden. originally opened in 1988, it operated a living museum for many years. as funding and attendance declined, the log buildings at the complex fell into disrepair, requiring it to close. since 2011 fundraising and restoration efforts have allowed it partially re-open.
