the algerian people’s national army (apna) is the armed forces of the people's democratic republic of algeria. algeria has a large and well-equipped military to counter foreign and domestic threats. it is the direct successor of the armée de libération nationale (aln), the armed wing of the nationalist national liberation front, which fought french colonial rule during the algerian war of independence (1954-1962). the people's national army include ground forces, the algerian air force, the navy (the marine de la république algérienne), and the algerian air defence force. the antecedents of the army were the conventional military units formed in morocco and tunisia during the war of independence from france. except for brief clashes with morocco in 1976, the armed forces have not been involved in hostilities against a foreign power. their combat capabilities in defence of the country has thus remained untested.
