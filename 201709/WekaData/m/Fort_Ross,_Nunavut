fort ross is an uninhabited former trading post in the qikiqtaaluk region of nunavut, canada. founded in 1937 it was the last trading post to be established by the hudson's bay company. situated on the bellot strait at the southeastern end of somerset island, it was operational for only eleven years as the severe ice conditions rendered it uneconomical and difficult to access. this left the island uninhabited. the former store was recently refurbished and strengthened, and is still used as a shelter by inuit caribou hunters from taloyoak, and as a refuge for researchers and small boat travellers passing through. henry larsen (explorer) reached it in 1942. in the summer of 2006, cbc's the national visited fort ross in their travels on the coast guard icebreaker louis s. st-laurent in a special series focused on climate change.
