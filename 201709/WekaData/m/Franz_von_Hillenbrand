franz von hillenbrand was a roman catholic german aristocrat. he was born in zolochiv, c. 1801, the polish city that time was part of the holy roman empire. his family migrated to the galizien region from augsburg in the late 18th century. it is unknown how many generations and members of the family lived in galicia and what the reason was to choose the city as a new place for the family. the only known is that franz von hillenbrand left zloczow in cca. 1841. he met ernestine emilia johanna von böckh (who lived in prague before), and got married on 21 august 1841 in pozsony (now bratislava), the administrative center of hungary that time. (ernestine von böckh was his second wife as the first died before.) both of them and their children (e.g. aemilian ernst franz xaver von hillenbrand and rudolf von hillenbrand) lived in wien-alpenvorstadt, where franz von hillenbrand worked as an imperial and royal accountant. not so later, they moved back to pozsony. according to some reminiscences, he has a brother named alexander von hillenbrand. he also worked in wien at the secretariat of the orden der eisernen krone. it needs some researches to clarify the life of the von hillenbrand family in zolochiv. we cannot exclude the possibility of other brothers and sisters married and lived in zolochiv after. due to the burnt of the entire city in the second half of the 19th century, and due to the soviet occupation in the 20th century, there is very little chance to find any referring documents in zolochiv.
