the glarus alps (german: glarner alpen) are a mountain range in central switzerland. they are bordered by the uri alps and the schwyz alps to the west, the lepontine alps to the south, the appenzell alps to the northeast. the eastern part of the glarus alps contains a major thrust fault which was declared a geologic unesco world heritage site (the swiss tectonic arena sardona). the glarus alps extend well beyond the canton of glarus, including parts of the cantons of uri, graub√ºnden, and st gallen. conversely, not all the mountains in the canton of glarus are part of the glarus alps, with those to the north of the urner boden and to the west of the valley of the river linth considered to be part of the schwyz alps.
