eutrophication (greek: eutrophia (from eu "well" + trephein "nourish".); german: eutrophie), or more precisely hypertrophication, is the depletion of oxygen in a water body, which kills aquatic animals. it is a response to the addition of excess nutrients, mainly phosphates, which induces explosive growth of plants and algae, the decaying of which consumes oxygen from the water. one example is the "bloom" or great increase of phytoplankton in a water body as a response to increased levels of nutrients. eutrophication is almost always induced by the discharge of phosphate-containing detergents, fertilizers, or sewage, into an aquatic system.
