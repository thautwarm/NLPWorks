denis lortie (born march 10, 1959) is a former canadian forces corporal. in 1984, he stormed into the national assembly of quebec building and opened fire with several firearms, killing three quebec government employees and wounding 13 others. the national assembly's sergeant-at-arms, ren√© jalbert, constituted himself hostage and negotiated with lortie for four hours to convince him to surrender. after a 1985 conviction of first-degree murder was overturned by the quebec court of appeal, lortie pleaded guilty to reduced charges of second-degree murder in 1987, for which he was convicted to life imprisonment with no parole for ten years. lortie was granted day parole in 1995, then full parole in 1996, and has since kept a low profile.
