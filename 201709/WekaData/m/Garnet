(for other uses, see garnet (disambiguation).) garnets (pronunciation: /ˈɡɑːrnᵻt/) are a group of silicate minerals that have been used since the bronze age as gemstones and abrasives. all species of garnets possess similar physical properties and crystal forms, but differ in chemical composition. the different species are pyrope, almandine, spessartine, grossular (varieties of which are hessonite or cinnamon-stone and tsavorite), uvarovite and andradite. the garnets make up two solid solution series: pyrope-almandine-spessartine and uvarovite-grossular-andradite.
