the treeshrews (or tree shrews or banxrings) are small mammals native to the tropical forests of southeast asia. they make up the families tupaiidae, the treeshrews, and ptilocercidae, the pen-tailed treeshrew, and the entire order scandentia. the 20 species are placed in five genera. treeshrews have a higher brain to body mass ratio than any other mammals, including humans, but high ratios are not uncommon for animals weighing less than a kilogram. though called 'treeshrews', they are not true shrews – though they were previously classified in insectivora – and not all species live in trees. among other things, treeshrews eat rafflesia fruit. among orders of mammals, treeshrews are closely related to primates, and have been used as an alternative to primates in experimental studies of myopia, psychosocial stress, and hepatitis.
