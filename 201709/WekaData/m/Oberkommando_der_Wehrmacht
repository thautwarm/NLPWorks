the oberkommando der wehrmacht (okw, "supreme command of the armed forces") was part of the command structure of the wehrmacht (armed forces) of nazi germany during world war ii. created in 1938, the okw had nominal oversight over the german army, the kriegsmarine (german navy) and the luftwaffe (german air force). rivalry with the armed services branch commands, mainly with the oberkommando des heeres (okh), prevented the okw from becoming a unified german general staff in an effective chain of command. however it did coordinate operations between the three services. during the war the okw, subordinate to adolf hitler as supreme commander of the wehrmacht, acquired more and more operational powers. by 1942 okw had responsibility for all theaters except for the eastern front against the soviet union. hitler manipulated the bipolar system to keep ultimate decisions in his own hands.
