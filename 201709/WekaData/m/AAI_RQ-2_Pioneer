the aai rq-2 pioneer is an unmanned aerial vehicle (uav) that had been utilized by the united states navy, marine corps, and army, and deployed at sea and on land from 1986 until 2007. initially tested aboard uss iowa, the rq-2 pioneer was placed aboard iowa-class battleships to provide gunnery spotting, its mission evolving into reconnaissance and surveillance, primarily for amphibious forces. it was developed jointly by aai corporation and israel aircraft industries. the program grew out of successful testing and field operation of the tadiran mastiff uav by the american and israeli militaries. essentially, the pioneer is an upgraded tadiran mastiff which was re-engined to accommodate a greater payload by request of the us navy. to accomplish this, the original "limbach" two-cylinder two-stroke engine was replaced with a fichtel & sachs two-cylinder two-stroke. the limbach motor utilized a 71 cm propeller from propeller engineering and duplicating, inc. of san clemente, california. the newer, more powerful fichtel & sachs motor was outfitted with a 74 cm propeller (which spins in the opposite direction) from the sensenich propeller manufacturing company of lancaster, pennsylvania.
