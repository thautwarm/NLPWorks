vincent van gogh's display at les xx, 1890, in brussels is an important testament to the recognition he received amongst avant-garde peers during his own lifetime. participation in the annual exhibition of les xx was for members and by invitation only. van gogh's choice proves that he was going for more than a simple selection of paintings he considered superior, but that he was willing to provide a well reasoned summary of his years of work in provence. evidently this notion remained neglected, and even more: it was washed away by the scandal his works provoked. then the same works were again shown at the annual exhibition of the artistes ind√©pendants in paris which offered space for an expansion of the display: this was done by theo van gogh, the brother of vincent, who was suffering from long lasting mental problems.
