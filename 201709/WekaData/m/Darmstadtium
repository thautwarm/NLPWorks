darmstadtium is a chemical element with symbol ds and atomic number 110. it is an extremely radioactive synthetic element. the most stable known isotope, darmstadtium-281, has a half-life of approximately 10 seconds. darmstadtium was first created in 1994 by the gsi helmholtz centre for heavy ion research near the city of darmstadt, germany, after which it was named. in the periodic table, it is a d-block transactinide element. it is a member of the 7th period and is placed in the group 10 elements, although no chemical experiments have yet been carried out to confirm that it behaves as the heavier homologue to platinum in group 10. darmstadtium is calculated to have similar properties to its lighter homologues, nickel, palladium, and platinum.
