the even-toed ungulates (order artiodactyla, from greek  ἄρτιος (ártios), meaning "even", and  δάκτυλος (dáktylos), meaning "finger/toe") are ungulates (hoofed animals) whose weight is borne equally by the third and fourth toes. by contrast, odd-toed ungulates, such as horses, bear their weight primarily on their third toe. the aquatic cetaceans (whales, dolphins, and porpoises) evolved from even-toed ungulate ancestors, and therefore modern taxonomic classification combines artiodactyla and cetacea into cetiartiodactyla. the roughly 220 artiodactyl species include pigs, peccaries, hippopotamuses, whales, camels, llamas, alpacas, mouse deer, deer, giraffes, antelopes, sheep, goats, and cattle, many of which are of great dietary, economic, and cultural importance to humans.
