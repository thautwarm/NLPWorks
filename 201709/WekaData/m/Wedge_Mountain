wedge mountain, 2895 m (9497 ft) prominence: 2249 m, often locally referred to as the wedge or simply "wedge", is the highest summit in the garibaldi ranges and therefore also garibaldi provincial park, and is among the nearest of the many peaks visible from the whistler blackcomb ski area, lying north across the valley of billygoat pass from the spearhead range, which includes one of that resort's two flagship mountains, blackcomb. it was named for its distinctive wedge shape by the garibaldi park board in 1932 in preference to mount vancouver, which had been submitted earlier. it is part of an unnamed range forming the most northerly group of peaks in the garibaldi ranges, the other two most notable being mount weart, known as the armchair because of its shape, and mount currie, which overlooks the indian reserve of the same name and the neighbouring town of pemberton. wedge's very high prominence is defined by the divide between the green and cheakamus rivers at a locality at the south end of alta lake known as tokum corners. the mountain sits astride the boundary between the new westminster and lillooet land districts.
