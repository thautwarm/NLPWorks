the hot mikado was a 1939 musical theatre adaptation of gilbert and sullivan's the mikado with an african-american cast. mike todd originally produced it after the federal theatre project turned down his offer to manage the wpa production of the swing mikado (another all-black adaptation of the mikado). the hot mikado was jazzier than the swing mikado and had a "full-voiced, star-studded cast to back up its sass." it follows both the story line of the mikado and the spectacle of the original and was noted for its wild costuming. "rosa brown's outfit, a winged dress with train and a gigantic hat, weighed thirty-five pounds." the spectacle and jazzed-up score received enthusiastic reviews and audiences; "critic george jean nathan presented it as the 'best all-around musical show,'named nat karson 'the seasonâ€™s best costumer,' and hailed two performers, rosa brown as 'best blues singer' and, to no one's surprise, bill 'bojangles' robinson as 'best hoofer.'"
