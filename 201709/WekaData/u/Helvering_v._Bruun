helvering v. bruun, 309 u.s. 461 (1940), was an income tax case before the supreme court of the united states. it is notable (and thus appears frequently in law school casebooks) for the following holding: under the section 22(a) of the revenue act of 1932, a landlord realizes a taxable gain when he repossesses property, the value of which has increased because the property was improved by a tenant.
