ricci v. destefano, 557 u.s. 557 (2009) is a us labor law case of the united states supreme court on unlawful discrimination through disparate impact under the civil rights act of 1964. eighteen city firefighters at the new haven fire department, seventeen white and one hispanic, claimed discrimination under title vii of the civil rights act of 1964 after they had passed the test for promotions to management positions and the city declined to promote them. new haven officials invalidated the test results because none of the black firefighters scored high enough to be considered for the positions. city officials stated that they feared a lawsuit over the test's disproportionate exclusion of certain racial groups from promotion under "disparate impact" head of liability. the supreme court held 5â€“4 that new haven's decision to ignore the test results violated title vii because the city did not have a "strong basis in evidence" that it would have subjected itself to disparate impact liability if it had promoted the white and hispanic firefighters instead of the black firefighters. because the plaintiffs won under their title vii claim, the court did not consider the plaintiffs' argument that new haven violated the constitutional right to equal protection.
