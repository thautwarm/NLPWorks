cox v. new hampshire, 312 u.s. 569 (1941), was a case in which the supreme court of the united states held that, although the government cannot regulate the contents of speech, it can place reasonable time, place, and manner restrictions on speech for the public safety. here, the court held that government may require organizers of any parade or procession on public streets to have a license and pay a fee. sixty-eight jehovah's witnesses had assembled at their church and divided into smaller groups that marched along sidewalks, displaying signs, and handing out leaflets advertising a meeting. during the march, groups of 15 to 20 people marched in single file down sidewalks in the district, interfering with normal foot travel. in 1941, all 68 jehovah's witnesses were convicted in a new hampshire municipal court for violating a state statute which prohibited parades and processions on public streets without a license. the defendants claimed that their first amendment rights were violated including their rights to freedom of worship and freedom of assembly.
