edwards v. aguillard, 482 u.s. 578 (1987) was a u.s. supreme court case concerning the constitutionality of teaching creationism. the court ruled that a louisiana law requiring that creation science be taught in public schools, along with evolution, violated the establishment clause of the first amendment because the law was specifically intended to advance a particular religion. it also held that "teaching a variety of scientific theories about the origins of humankind to school children might be validly done with the clear secular intent of enhancing the effectiveness of science instruction". in support of aguillard, 72 nobel prize-winning scientists, 17 state academies of science, and seven other scientific organizations filed amicus briefs that described creation science as being composed of religious tenets.
