cherokee nation v. georgia, 30 u.s. (5 peters) 1 (1831), was a united states supreme court case. the cherokee nation sought a federal injunction against laws passed by the u.s. state of georgia depriving them of rights within its boundaries, but the supreme court did not hear the case on its merits. it ruled that it had no original jurisdiction in the matter, as the cherokees were a dependent nation, with a relationship to the united states like that of a "ward to its guardian," as said by justice marshall.
