yakus v. united states, 321 u.s. 414 (1944), was a decision by the united states supreme court which upheld congressional power to fetter judicial review and to delegate broad and flexible law-making power to an administrative agency in this constitutional challenge to the emergency price control act of 1942. the wartime anti-inflation measure, intended to expedite price control enforcement, conferred on the federal district courts jurisdiction over violations of office of price administration (opa) regulations made under the act. but judicial power to consider the constitutionality of such regulations was accepted. congress specified that challenges to their validity be initially reviewed under stringent time limitations by the opa and on appeal exclusively by a special article iii tribunal in the district of columbia—the emergency court of appeals—and thereafter by the supreme court.
