balzac v. porto rico, 258 u.s. 298 (1922), was a case in which the supreme court of the united states held that certain provisions of the u.s. constitution did not apply to territories not incorporated into the union. it originated when jes√∫s m. balzac was prosecuted for criminal libel in a district court of puerto rico. balzac declared that his rights had been violated under the sixth amendment to the u.s. constitution as he was denied a trial by jury, since the code of criminal procedure of puerto rico did not grant a jury trial in misdemeanor cases. in the appeal, the u.s. supreme court affirmed the judgments of the lower courts on the island in deciding that the provisions of the constitution did not apply to a territory that belonged to the united states but was not incorporated into the union. it has become known as one of the "insular cases".
