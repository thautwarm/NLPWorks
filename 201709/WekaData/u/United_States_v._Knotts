united states v. knotts, 460 u.s. 276 (1983), was a united states supreme court case regarding the use of an electronic surveillance device. the defendants argued that the use of this device was a fourth amendment violation. the device in question was described as a beeper that could only be tracked from a short distance. during a single trip, officers followed a car containing the beeper, relying on beeper signal to determine the car's final destination. the court unanimously held that since the use of such a device did not violate a legitimate expectation of privacy there was no search and seizure and thus the use was allowed without a warrant. it reasoned that a person traveling in public has no expectation of privacy in one's movements. since there was no search and seizure there was not a fourth amendment violation.
