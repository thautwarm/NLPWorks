united states v. karo, 468 u.s. 705 (1984), was a united states supreme court decision related to the fourth amendment protection from unreasonable search and seizure. it held that use of an electronic beeper device to monitor a can of ether without a warrant constituted an unlawful search. however, the court upheld the conviction of karo and his accomplices, stating that the warrant affidavit contained enough information not derived from the unlawful use of the beeper to provide sufficient basis for probable cause.
