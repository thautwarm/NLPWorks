mclaughlin v. florida 379 u.s. 184 (1964), was a case in which the united states supreme court ruled unanimously that a cohabitation law of florida, part of the state's anti-miscegenation laws, was unconstitutional. the law prohibited habitual cohabitation by two unmarried people of opposite sex, if one is black, and the other, white. the decision overturned pace v. alabama (1883), which had declared such statutes constitutional. it did not overturn the related florida statute that prohibited interracial marriage between whites and blacks. such laws were declared unconstitutional in 1967 in loving v. virginia.
