dickerson v. united states, 530 u.s. 428 (2000), upheld the requirement that the miranda warning be read to criminal suspects and struck down a federal statute that purported to overrule miranda v. arizona (1966). the court noted that neither party in the case advocated on behalf of the constitutionality of 18 u.s.c. ยง 3501, the specific statute at issue in the case. accordingly, it invited paul cassell, a former law clerk to antonin scalia and warren e. burger, to argue that perspective. cassell was then a professor at the university of utah law school; he was later appointed to, and subsequently resigned from, a federal district court judgeship in that state.
