the bataan death march (japanese: バターン死の行進 hepburn: batān shi no kōshin, filipino: martsa ng kamatayan sa bataan) was the forcible transfer by the imperial japanese army of 60,000–80,000 filipino and american prisoners of war from saisaih point and mariveles to camp o'donnell, capas, tarlac, via san fernando, pampanga, where the prisoners were loaded onto trains. the transfer began on april 9, 1942, after the three-month battle of bataan in the philippines during world war ii. about 2,500–10,000 filipino and 100–650 american prisoners of war died on the march before they reached their destination. the reported death tolls vary, especially among filipino pows, because historians cannot determine how many prisoners blended in with the civilian population and escaped. the 60 mi (97 km) march was characterized by severe physical abuse. it was later judged by an allied military commission to be a japanese war crime.
