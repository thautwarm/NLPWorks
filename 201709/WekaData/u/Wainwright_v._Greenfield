wainwright v. greenfield, 474 u.s. 284 (1986), is a case in which the united states supreme court reversed the lower court's finding and overturned the petitioner's conviction, on the grounds that it was fundamentally unfair for the prosecutor to comment during the court proceedings on the petitioner's silence invoked as a result of a miranda warning.
