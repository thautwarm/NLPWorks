giglio v. united states, 405 u.s. 150 (1972), is a united states supreme court case in which the court held that the prosecution's failure to inform the jury that a witness had been promised not to be prosecuted in exchange for his testimony was a failure to fulfill the duty to present all material evidence to the jury, and constituted a violation of due process, requiring a new trial. this is the case even if the failure to disclose was a matter of negligence and not intent. the case extended the court's holding in brady v. maryland, requiring such agreements to be disclosed to defense counsel. as a result of this case, the term giglio material is sometimes used to refer to any information pertaining to deals that witnesses in a criminal case may have entered into with the government.
