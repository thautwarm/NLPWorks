colegrove v. green, 328 u.s. 549 (1946), was a united states supreme court case. writing for a 4-3 plurality, justice felix frankfurter held that the federal judiciary had no power to interfere with issues regarding apportionment of state legislatures. the court held that article i, section iv of the u.s. constitution left to the legislature of each state the authority to establish the time, place, and manner of holding elections for representatives, and that only congress (and thus not the federal judiciary) could determine whether individual state legislatures had fulfilled their responsibility to secure fair representation for citizens. however, in baker v. carr, 369 u.s. 186 (1962) the united states supreme court distinguished the colegrove decision holding that malapportionment claims under the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment were not exempt from judicial review under article iv, section 4, as the equal protection issue in this case was separate from any political questions. the "one person, one vote" doctrine which requires electoral districts to be apportioned according to population, thus making each district roughly equal in population, was further cemented in the cases that followed baker v. carr, including gray v. sanders, 372 u.s. 368 (1963) which concerned state county districts, reynolds v. sims, 377 u.s. 533 (1964) which concerned state legislature districts, wesberry v. sanders, 376 u.s. 1 (1964) which concerned u.s. congressional districts and avery v. midland county, 390 u.s. 474 (1968) which concerned local government districts, a decision which was upheld in board of estimate of city of new york v. morris, 489 u.s. 688 (1989).
