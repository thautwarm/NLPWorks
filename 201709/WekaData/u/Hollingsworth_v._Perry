hollingsworth v. perry refers to a series of united states federal court cases that legalized same-sex marriage in the state of california. the case began in 2009 in the u.s. district court for the northern district of california, which found that banning same-sex marriage violates equal protection under the law. this decision overturned ballot initiative proposition 8, which had banned same-sex marriage. after the state of california refused to defend proposition 8, the official sponsors of proposition 8 intervened and appealed to the supreme court. it reached the united states supreme court as hollingsworth v. perry, who held that in line with prior precedent, the official sponsors of a ballot initiative measure did not have article iii standing to appeal an adverse federal court ruling when the state refused to do so. the salient effect of the ruling was that same-sex marriage in california resumed under the district court trial decision from 2010. the case was docketed with the supreme court at 570 u.s. ___ (2013) (docket no. 12-144). the case was litigated during the governorships of both arnold schwarzenegger and jerry brown, and was thus known as perry v. schwarzenegger and perry v. brown, respectively.
