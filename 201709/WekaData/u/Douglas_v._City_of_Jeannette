douglas v. city of jeannette, 319 u.s. 157 (1943), was a case in which the supreme court of the united states held it does not restrain criminal prosecutions made in good faith unless there would be some "irreparable injury." this case is one of four cases collectively known as the "jehovah's witnesses cases", because the supreme court handed down rulings on these four cases related to the jehovah's witnesses on the same day (may 3, 1943). although the supreme court ruled against the jehovah's witnesses in this case, it ruled in favor of them in the other three cases and those represent landmark decisions in the area of first amendment constitutional law.
