edmonson v. leesville concrete company, 500 u.s. 614 (1991), was a united states supreme court case which held that peremptory challenges may not be used to exclude jurors on the basis of race in civil trials. edmonson extended the court's similar decision in batson v. kentucky (1986), a criminal case. the court applied the equal protection component of the due process clause of the fifth amendment, as determined in bolling v. sharpe (1954), in finding that such race-based challenges violated the constitution.
