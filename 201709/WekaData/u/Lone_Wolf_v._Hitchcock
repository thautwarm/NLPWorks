lone wolf v. hitchcock, 187 u.s. 553 (1903) was a united states supreme court case brought against the us government by the kiowa chief lone wolf, who charged that native american tribes under the medicine lodge treaty had been defrauded of land by congressional actions in violation of the treaty. the court declared that the "plenary power" of the united states congress gave it authority to unilaterally abrogate treaty obligations between the united states and native american tribes. the decision marked a departure from the holdings of cherokee nation v. georgia, 30 u.s. 1 (1831), and worcester v. georgia, 31 u.s. 515 (1832), which had shown greater respect for the autonomy of native american tribes.
