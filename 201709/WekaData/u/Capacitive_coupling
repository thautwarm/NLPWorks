capacitive coupling is the transfer of energy within an electrical network or between distant networks by means of displacement current between circuit(s)  nodes, induced by the electric field. this coupling can have an intentional or accidental effect. in its simplest implementation, capacitive coupling is achieved by placing a capacitor between two nodes. in its general form the coupling is described by a capacitance matrix cij. where cii are self-capacitance coefficients and cij iâ‰ j are mutual capacitance coefficients.
