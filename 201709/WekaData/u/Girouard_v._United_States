girouard v. united states, 328 u.s. 61 (1946), was a case decided by the supreme court of the united states. it concerned a pacifist applicant for naturalization who in the interview declared not to be willing to fight for the defense of the united states. the case questioned a precedent set by united states v. schwimmer in 1929 that denied an applicant entry to the united states because of her pacifist stance. girouard v. united states overturned that precedent by voting in favor of girouard's religious freedom through allowing him to uphold his seventh-day adventist beliefs.
