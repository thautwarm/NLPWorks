the magpie-lark (grallina cyanoleuca) is a conspicuous australian bird of small to medium size, also known as the mudlark in victoria and western australia, the murray magpie in south australia, and as the peewee in new south wales and queensland. it had been relegated to a subfamily of fantails in the family dicruridae (drongos), but has been placed in a new family of monarchidae (monarch flycatchers) since 2008. it is a common and very widespread bird both in urban and rural areas, occupying all parts of australia except for tasmania and some of the inland desert in the far north-west of western australia, and appears to have adapted well to the presence of humans. it is also found in southern new guinea.
