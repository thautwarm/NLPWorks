the worldwide lhc computing grid (wlcg), formerly (until 2006) the lhc computing grid (lcg), is an international collaborative project that consists of a grid-based computer network infrastructure incorporating over 170 computing centers in 36 countries, as of 2012. it was designed by cern to handle the prodigious volume of data produced by large hadron collider (lhc) experiments. by 2012, data from over 300 trillion (3Ã—1014) lhc proton-proton collisions had been analyzed, and lhc collision data was being produced at approximately 25 petabytes per year. as of 2012, the lhc computing grid had become the world's largest computing grid comprising over 170 computing facilities in a worldwide network across 36 countries.
