the formate-nitrite transporter (fnt) family (tc# 1.a.16) is a family of homologous transmembrane proteins belonging to the major intrinsic protein (mip) superfamily. fnt family members have been sequenced from gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, archaea, yeast, plants and lower eukaryotes. the prokaryotic proteins of the fnt family probably function in the transport of the structurally related compounds, formate and nitrite.
