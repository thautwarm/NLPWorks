cranial nerves are the nerves that emerge directly from the brain (including the brainstem), in contrast to spinal nerves (which emerge from segments of the spinal cord). cranial nerves relay information between the brain and parts of the body, primarily to and from regions of the head and neck. spinal nerves emerge sequentially from the spinal cord with the spinal nerve closest to the head (c1) emerging in the space above the first cervical vertebra. the cranial nerves, however, emerge from the central nervous system above this level. each cranial nerve is paired and is present on both sides. depending on definition in humans there are twelve or thirteen cranial nerves pairs, which are assigned roman numerals iâ€“xii, sometimes also including cranial nerve zero. the numbering of the cranial nerves is based on the order in which they emerge from the brain, front to back (brainstem). the terminal nerves, olfactory nerves (i) and optic nerves (ii) emerge from the cerebrum or forebrain, and the remaining ten pairs arise from the brainstem, which is the lower part of the brain. the cranial nerves are considered components of the peripheral nervous system (pns), although on a structural level the olfactory, optic and terminal nerves are more accurately considered part of the central nervous system (cns).
