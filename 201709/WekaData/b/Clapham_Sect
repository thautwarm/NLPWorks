the clapham sect or clapham saints were a group of church of england social reformers based in clapham, london at the beginning of the 19th century (active 1780sâ€“1840s). john newton (1725-1807) was the founder. they are described by the historian stephen michael tomkins as "a network of friends and families in england, with william wilberforce as its centre of gravity, who were powerfully bound together by their shared moral and spiritual values, by their religious mission and social activism, by their love for each other, and by marriage". by 1848 when an evangelical john bird sumner became archbishop of canterbury, between the fourth and third of all anglican clergy were linked to the movement, which by then had diversified greatly in its goals and they were no longer considered an organized faction.
