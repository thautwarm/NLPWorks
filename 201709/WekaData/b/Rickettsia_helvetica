rickettsia helvetica is a bacterium found in dermacentor reticulatus and other ticks which has been implicated as a suspected but unconfirmed human pathogen. first recognized in 1979 in ixodes ricinus ticks in switzerland (hence the designation helvetica) as a new member of the spotted fever group of rickettsia, the rickettsia helvetica bacterium was eventually isolated in 1993. although r. helvetica was initially thought to be harmless in humans and many animal species, some individual case reports suggest that it may be capable of causing a non-specific fever in humans. in 1997 a man living in eastern france seroconverted to rickettsia 4 weeks after onset of an unexplained febrile illness. in 2010, a case report indicated that tick-borne r. helvetica can also cause meningitis in humans. molecular evidence suggests that in croatia as many as 10% of dermacentor reticulatus ticks are infected with r. helvetica.
