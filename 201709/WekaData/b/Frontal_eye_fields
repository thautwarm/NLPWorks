the frontal eye fields (fef) are a region located in the frontal cortex, more specifically in brodmann area 8 or ba8, of the primate brain. in humans, it can be more accurately said to lie in a region around the intersection of the middle frontal gyrus with the precentral gyrus, consisting of a frontal and parietal portion. the fef is responsible for saccadic eye movements for the purpose of visual field perception and awareness, as well as for voluntary eye movement. the fef communicates with extraocular muscles indirectly via the paramedian pontine reticular formation. destruction to fef causes deviation of the eyes to the ipsilateral side.
