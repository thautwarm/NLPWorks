ferroelectricity is a property of certain materials that have a spontaneous electric polarization that can be reversed by the application of an external electric field. the term is used in analogy to ferromagnetism, in which a material exhibits a permanent magnetic moment. ferromagnetism was already known when ferroelectricity was discovered in 1920 in rochelle salt by valasek. thus, the prefix ferro, meaning iron, was used to describe the property despite the fact that most ferroelectric materials do not contain iron.
