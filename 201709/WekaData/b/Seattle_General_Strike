the seattle general strike of 1919 was a five-day general work stoppage by more than 65,000 workers in the city of seattle, washington, which lasted from february 6 to february 11 of that year. dissatisfied workers in several unions began the strike to gain higher wages after two years of world war i wage controls. most other local unions, including members of the american federation of labor (afl) and the industrial workers of the world (iww), joined the walkout. although the strike was non-violent and lasted less than a week, government officials, the press, and much of the public viewed the strike as a radical attempt to subvert us institutions. some commentators raised alarm by calling it the work of bolsheviks and other radicals inspired by "un-american" ideologies, making it the first concentrated eruption of the anti-red hysteria that characterized the red scare of 1919 and 1920.
