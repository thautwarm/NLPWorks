the paraventricular nucleus (pvn, pva, or pvh) is a neuronal nucleus in the hypothalamus. it contains groups of neurons that can be activated by stressful and/or physiological changes. many pvn neurons project directly to the posterior pituitary where they release oxytocin or vasopressin into the general circulation. other pvn neurons control various anterior pituitary functions, while still others directly regulate appetite and autonomic functions in the brainstem and spinal cord.
