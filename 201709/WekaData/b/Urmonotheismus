urmonotheismus (german for "primeval monotheism") or primitive monotheism is the hypothesis of a monotheistic urreligion, from which non-monotheistic religions degenerated. this is diametrically opposed to the evolutionary view of religion, another hypothesis which holds that religion progressed from simple forms to complex: first preanimism, then animism, totemism, polytheism and finally monotheism (see anthropology of religion).
