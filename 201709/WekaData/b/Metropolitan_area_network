a metropolitan area network (man) is a computer network that interconnects users with computer resources in a geographic area or region larger than that covered by even a large local area network (lan) but smaller than the area covered by a wide area network (wan). the term is applied to the interconnection of networks in a city into a single larger network (which may then also offer efficient connection to a wide area network). it is also used to mean the interconnection of several local area networks by bridging them with backbone lines. the latter usage is also sometimes referred to as a campus network.
