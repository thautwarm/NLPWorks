ashland bus system (abs) provides the municipal bus service in the city of ashland, kentucky and its nearby suburbs. unlike many such services, it is operated by the city government itself. its routes also reach the suburbs, including ceredo, west virginia and kenova, west virginia. this is a result of a dispute between those twin cities, and the west virginia and ohio bus system known as the tri-state transit authority, known as tta. all buses center on ashland transportation center, which is also used by the greyhound system as well as amtrak. the service provides interchange between itself and tta via a tta bus that travels from ironton, ohio across the bridge into ashland and the ashland transportation center. it however does not interchange with tta in west virginia, even though the buses pass within a few blocks of one another.
