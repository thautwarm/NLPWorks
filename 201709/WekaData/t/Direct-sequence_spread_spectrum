in the telecommunications, direct-sequence spread spectrum (dsss) is a spread spectrum modulation technique. spread spectrum systems are such that they transmit the message bearing signals using a bandwidth that is in excess of the bandwidth that is actually needed by the message signal. this spreading of the transmitted signal over a large bandwidth make the resulting wideband signal appear as a noise signal which allows greater resistance to intentional and unintentional interference with the transmitted signal. one of the methods of achieving this spreading of the message signal is provided by dsss modulation. in dsss the message signal is used to modulate a bit sequence known as the pseudo noise (pn) code; this pn code consists of pulses of a much shorter duration (larger bandwidth) than the pulse duration of the message signal, therefore the modulation by the message signal has the effect of chopping up the pulses of the message signal and thereby resulting in a signal which has a bandwidth nearly as large as that of the pn sequence. in this context the duration of the pulse of the pn code is referred to as the chip duration and the smaller this value, the larger the bandwidth of the resultant dsss signal and the more immune to interference the resultant signal becomes. some of the uses of dsss include the code division multiple access (cdma) channel access method and the ieee 802.11b specification used in wi-fi networks.
