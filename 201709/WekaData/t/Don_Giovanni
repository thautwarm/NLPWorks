don giovanni (italian pronunciation: [dɔn dʒoˈvanni]; k. 527; complete title: il dissoluto punito, ossia il don giovanni, literally the rake punished, namely don giovanni or the libertine punished) is an opera in two acts with music by wolfgang amadeus mozart and italian libretto by lorenzo da ponte. it is based on the legends of don juan, a fictional libertine and seducer. it was premiered by the prague italian opera at the teatro di praga (now called the estates theatre) on 29 october 1787. da ponte's libretto was billed, like many of its time, as dramma giocoso, a term that denotes a mixing of serious and comic action. mozart entered the work into his catalogue as an opera buffa. although sometimes classified as comic, it blends comedy, melodrama and supernatural elements. a staple of the standard operatic repertoire, don giovanni is currently tenth on the operabase list of the most-performed operas worldwide. it has also proved a fruitful subject for writers and philosophers.
