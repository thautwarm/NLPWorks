the ncaa division ii women's tennis championship is the national collegiate athletic association's tennis tournament to determine the team championships, singles championships, and doubles championships for women's tennis athletes from division ii institutions. tennis was one of twelve women's sports added to the ncaa championship program for the 1981-82 school year, as the ncaa engaged in battle with the association for intercollegiate athletics for women for sole governance of women's collegiate sports. the aiaw continued to conduct its established championship program in the same twelve (and other) sports; however, after a year of dual women's championships, the ncaa conquered the aiaw and usurped its authority and membership. from its establishment in 1982 until 1994, the championship consisted of three championships: singles, doubles, and team. however, the singles and doubles titles were discontinued after 1994 and have not been reestablished. armstrong state is the most successful program, with eight national titles.
