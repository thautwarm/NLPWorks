bubblegum pop (also known as bubblegum music or simply bubblegum) is a genre of pop music with an upbeat sound contrived and marketed to appeal to pre-teens and teenagers, that may be produced in an assembly-line process, driven by producers and often using unknown singers. bubblegum's classic period ran from 1967 to 1972. a second wave of bubblegum started two years later and ran until 1977 when disco took over and punk rock emerged. the genre was predominantly a singles phenomenon rather than an album-oriented one. also, because many acts were manufactured in the studio using session musicians, a large number of bubblegum songs were by one-hit wonders. among the best-known acts of bubblegum's golden era are 1910 fruitgum company, the ohio express and the archies, an animated group which had the most successful bubblegum song with "sugar, sugar", billboard magazine's no. 1 single for 1969. singer tommy roe, arguably, had the most bubblegum hits of any artist during this period, notably 1969's "dizzy".
