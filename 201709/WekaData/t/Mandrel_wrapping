in multimode fiber optics, mandrel wrapping is a technique used to preferentially attenuate high-order mode power of a propagating optical signal. consequently, if the fibre is propagating substantial energy in affected modes, the modal distribution will be changed. a cylindrical rod wrap consists of a specified number turns of fiber on a mandrel of specified size, depending on the fibre characteristics and the desired modal distribution. it has application in optical transmission performance tests, to create a defined mode power distribution or to prevent multimode propagation in single mode fibre. if the launch fibre is fully filled ahead of the mandrel wrap, the higher-order modes will be stripped off, leaving only lower-order modes. if the launch fibre is underfilled, for example as a consequence of being energized by a laser diode or edge-emitting led, there will be no effect on the mode power distribution or loss measurements. in multimode fibre, mandrel wrapping is used to eliminate the effect of "transient loss", the tendency of high order modes to experience higher loss than lower order modes. numerical addition (in decibels) of the measured loss of multiple fibre segments and/or components overestimates the loss of the concatenated set if each segment or component has been measured with a full mode power distribution. in single mode optical fibre measurements, it is used to enforce true single mode propagation at wavelengths near or below the theoretical cutoff wavelength, at which substantial power can exist in a higher order mode group. in this use, it is commonly termed a high order mode filter (homf). ultimately, the effect of mandrel wrapping on optical measurements depends on the propagating mode power distribution. an additional loss mechanism has no effect unless power is present in the affected modes.
