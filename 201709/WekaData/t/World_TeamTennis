world team tennis is a mixed-gender professional tennis league played with a team format in the united states, which was founded in 1973. originally played on a no-line court, each match consists of five sets. each set features a different configuration (men's singles, men's doubles, women's singles, women's doubles, and mixed doubles). prior to each match, coaches decide the order in which the sets will be played. each player on a team usually plays in at least one of the five sets. scoring is no-advantage; there is no requirement to win a game by two scores; at deuce (3-3, the equivalent of 40-40 in a conventional scoring system), whoever scores the next point wins the game. the first team to reach five games wins each set. a nine-point tiebreaker is played, if a set reaches four-all. one point is awarded for each game won. if necessary, overtime and a super-tiebreaker are played to determine the winner of the match. the league's season normally takes place in the summer months. players from the atp and wta take a break from their tour schedules to partake in world teamtennis.
