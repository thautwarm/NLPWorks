the major system (also called the phonetic number system, phonetic mnemonic system, or herigone's mnemonic system) is a mnemonic technique used to aid in memorizing numbers. the system works by converting numbers into consonant sounds, then into words by adding vowels. the system works on the principle that images can be remembered more easily than numbers.
