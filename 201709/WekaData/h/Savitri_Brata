savitri vrata (nepali: सावित्री ब्रत), (odia: ସାବିତ୍ରୀ ଓଷା or ସାବିତ୍ରୀ ବ୍ରତ) or savitri amavasya (odia: ସାବିତ୍ରୀ ଅମାବାସ୍ୟା) is a fasting day observed by married hindu odia and maithil women of nepalese mithila and india on the amavasya, the no moon day in the bikram sambat month of jestha. it is also known as sabitri uwaans in western odisha region. married hindu women, whose husbands are alive, observe it as a vow with great dedication and pray for their husband to have a long life. the word reflects the origin and significance of the vat-savitri puja. the fast is dedicated to savitri and satyavan; her husband who was destined to die within one year but was brought back to life by her penance. the god of death, yama, is implored by savitri when he is about to leave his body. due to her sheer determination and devotion to her husband, she won him back to life. soon satyavan regained his lost kingdom. the same festival is observed on vat purnima, the full moon of jyestha in other regions like maharashtra, goa, gujarat, karnataka.
