the falles (valencian: falles, sing. falla; spanish: fallas) is a traditional celebration held in commemoration of saint joseph in the city of valencia, spain. the term falles refers to both the celebration and the monuments burnt during the celebration. a number of towns in the valencian community have similar celebrations inspired by the original falles de valéncia celebration. each neighbourhood of the city has an organised group of people, the casal faller, that works all year long holding fundraising parties and dinners, usually featuring the famous dish, paella, a specialty of the region. each casal faller produces a construction known as a falla which is eventually burnt. a casal faller is also known as a comissió fallera.
