the specific weight (also known as the unit weight) is the weight per unit volume of a material. the symbol of specific weight is γ (the greek letter gamma). a commonly used value is the specific weight of water on earth at 5°c which is 9.807 kn/m3 or 62.43 lbf/ft3. the terms specific gravity, and less often specific weight, are also used for relative density.
