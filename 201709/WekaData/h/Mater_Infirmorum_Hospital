the mater infirmorum hospital, commonly known as the mater is an acute hospital in belfast, northern ireland and serves a population of over 200,000 people. it provides services to most of north belfast and south antrim, reaching as far as glengormley, carrickfergus and newtownabbey. it also provides a psychiatric service for north belfast and west belfast. the trust provides a wide range of services including acute in-patient, a&e, day procedures, mental illness and maternity. the latin word mater is commonly pronounced both "matt-er" and "mae-ter" by residents of the city (the pronunciation does not denote anything about religion or political sympathies of the speaker) this has led to the phrase "you go to the maeter to find out what's the matter".
