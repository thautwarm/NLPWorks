in telecommunications, the principal clock of a set of redundant clocks, is the clock that is selected for normal use. the principal clock may be selected because of a property, e.g. superior accuracy, that makes it a unique member of the set. the term "principal clock" should not be confused with, or used as a synonym for, the term "primary frequency standard."
