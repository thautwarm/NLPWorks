the greensboro generals were an echl team based in greensboro, north carolina that existed from 1999–2004. the franchise replaced the greensboro monarchs, who called the city home from 1989–1995. the 'generals' name was originally used by the city's eastern hockey league and southern hockey league franchises. the ehl team played from 1959 through 1972, and the shl team played from 1973 through the league's mid-season failure in 1977. both the original generals and monarchs are considered to this day as one of the first southern hockey franchises to build a loyal fan base and draw consistent attendance at their games. the echl generals played at the greensboro coliseum from 1999–2004. the coliseum hosted the nhl carolina hurricanes from 1997–1999 after their departure from hartford, connecticut. during that time a new arena would be built for the nhl team in raleigh, north carolina. prior to their arrival, the hurricanes and the coliseum were required to make vast improvements to the arena in order to satisfy nhl regulations. among them were the addition of vip suites, a members only club area and upgrades to the ice surface and locker room facilities. following the hurricanes' departure, local attorneys art donaldson and james roscetti entered into negotiations with the east coast hockey league to secure a franchise for greensboro. donaldson and roscetti were awarded a franchise in july 1999 and had only 3 months to put together a front office, coaching staff and team. donaldson and roscetti decided to bring attention to the franchise right away by hiring jeff brubaker as head coach and general manager for their inaugural season. as of 2005, there are no plans to bring a professional hockey team back to greensboro.
