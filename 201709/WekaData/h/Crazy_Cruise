crazy cruise is a 1942 warner bros. cartoon in the merrie melodies series. it was directed by tex avery and bob clampett, whose names do not appear on the surviving print of the cartoon. because tex left the studio in september 1941 before production was completed (it was the last he worked on), clampett finished it, and both names were officially left off the credits. the only credits given are the story by michael maltese, animation by rod scribner, and musical direction by carl stalling.
