jewish american heritage month (jahm) is an annual recognition and celebration of jewish american achievements in and contributions to the united states of america. efforts are underway to encourage the annual observation of jahm in the u.s. during the month of may. president george w. bush issued a ceremonial proclamation on april 20, 2006, inviting the nation to recognize jahm in may 2006. in the united states, a presidential proclamation does not have the force of law, and is considered to be largely symbolic in nature. in april 2006, president bush also made proclamations pertaining to the following for the year 2006: national former prisoner of war recognition day, education and sharing day, national d.a.r.e. day, pan american day and pan american week, thomas jefferson day, national park week, national volunteer week, national physical fitness and sports month, national crime victims' rights week, national charter schools week, asian/pacific american heritage month, law day, loyalty day, older americans month, and the national day of prayer. this is the achievement of rep. debbie wasserman schultz (d-fl) and sen. arlen specter (d-pa), as well as the jewish museum of florida and the south florida jewish community. a similar month exists in florida as florida jewish history month but it occurs in january.
