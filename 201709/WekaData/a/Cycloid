a cycloid is the curve traced by a point on the rim of a circular wheel as the wheel rolls along a straight line without slippage.it is an example of a roulette, a curve generated by a curve rolling on another curve. the cycloid, with the cusps pointing upward, is the curve of fastest descent under constant gravity, and is also the form of a curve for which the period of an object in descent on the curve does not depend on the object's starting position.
