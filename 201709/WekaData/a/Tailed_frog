the tailed frogs are two species of frogs in the genus ascaphus, the only taxon in the family ascaphidae /æˈskæfᵻdiː/. the "tail" in the name is actually an extension of the male cloaca. the tail is one of two distinctive anatomical features adapting the species to life in fast-flowing streams. these are the only north american frog species that reproduce by internal fertilization. its scientific names means ‘without a spade’, from the privative prefix a- and the ancient greek skaphís (σκαφίς, ‘spade, shovel’), referring to the metatarsal spade, which these frogs do not have.
