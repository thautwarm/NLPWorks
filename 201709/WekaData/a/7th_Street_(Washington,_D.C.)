there are two north-south arteries in washington, d.c. named 7th street that are differentiated by the quadrants of the city in which they are located. historically, 7th street has been a main north-south road in washington, being the main route for travelers and farmers coming into the city from the north. this is evident in its intersection with mount vernon square, a historically important public space, as well as the original central market, located at the intersection of seventh, pennsylvania, and indiana avenues. the space occupied by this central market has now become the location of the navy memorial. seventh street forms major intersections at pennsylvania ave, e street nw, h street nw, k street nw, and massachusetts avenue.
