the trabant /trəˈbɑːnt/ is an automobile that was produced from 1957 to 1990 by former east german auto maker veb sachsenring automobilwerke zwickau in zwickau, saxony. it is often regarded as a symbol of the defunct east germany, and of the collapse of the eastern bloc in general. the car was known for being uncomfortable, slow, noisy, and dirty. nevertheless, it was very sought after in east germany before the fall of the berlin wall, with a waiting period for the purchase of a new trabant lasting more than a decade. it had a hard plastic body, mounted to a single-piece steel chassis (a so-called unibody or monocoque), front-wheel drive, a transversely-mounted engine, and independent suspension, features unusual for the era. dubbed a "spark plug with a roof", the trabant was produced for nearly 30 years with almost no significant changes to its design. 3,096,099 vehicles were produced in total. older models of the car later became popular among collectors in the united states due to their low cost and the fewer restrictions on importing antique cars. the trabant also gained a following among car tuning enthusiasts and for use in rally racing and other motorsports.
