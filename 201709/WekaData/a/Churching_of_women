in christian tradition the churching of women is the ceremony wherein a blessing is given to mothers after recovery from childbirth. the ceremony includes thanksgiving for the woman's survival of childbirth, and is performed even when the child is stillborn, or has died unbaptized. although the ceremony itself contains no elements of ritual purification, it was related to jewish practice as noted in leviticus 12:2-8, where women were purified after giving birth. in light of the new testament, the christian ritual draws on the imagery and symbolism of the presentation of jesus at the temple luke 2:22-40. although some christian traditions consider her to have borne christ without incurring impurity, she went to the temple in jerusalem to fulfill the requirements of the law of moses. at one time the rite was practiced in both the eastern and the western churches. the custom is first mentioned in pseudo-nicene arabic canon law. the religious ceremony has largely fallen out of practice in the west, but it continues in some parts of eastern christianity. the practice was dropped by the rc church after the second vatican council 1965/67.
