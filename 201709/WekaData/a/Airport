an airport is an aerodrome with facilities for flights to take off and land. airports often have facilities to store and maintain aircraft, and a control tower. an airport consists of a landing area, which comprises an aerially accessible open space including at least one operationally active surface such as a runway for a plane to take off or a helipad, and often includes adjacent utility buildings such as control towers, hangars and terminals. larger airports may have fixed-base operator services, airport aprons, taxiway bridges, air traffic control centres, passenger facilities such as restaurants and lounges, and emergency services. an airport with a helipad for rotorcraft but no runway is called a heliport. an airport for use by seaplanes and amphibious aircraft is called a seaplane base. such a base typically includes a stretch of open water for takeoffs and landings, and seaplane docks for tying-up. an international airport has additional facilities for customs and passport control. in warfare, airports can become the focus of intense fighting, for example the battle of tripoli airport or the battle for donetsk airport, both taking place in 2014. an airport primarily for military use is called an airbase or air station. most of the world's airports are owned by local, regional, or national government bodies.
