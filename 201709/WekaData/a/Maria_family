the maria or marian asteroids are a group of about 89 asteroids that orbit the sun with distances between about 2.52âˆ’2.62 au. they were initially identified by japanese astronomer kiyotsugu hirayama in 1918. asteroids in this family typically have an inclination of 12 to 17 degrees. the family gets its name from its lowest numbered member, the asteroid 170 maria. although asteroid 695 bella has orbital properties that make it a candidate for this dynamic family, the spectral properties of the object indicate it is most likely an interloper. instead, it may have been spalled off from 6 hebe, or its parent body.
