in taxonomy, ferroplasma is a genus of the ferroplasmaceae. the genus ferroplasma consists solely of three species. its type species, f. acidophilum, is an acidophilic iron-oxidizing member of the euryarchaeota. it is generally found in acidic mine tailings, being especially abundant in cases of severe acid mine drainage, where other organisms such as acidithiobacillus and leptospirillum have lowered the ph of the environment such that the obligately acidophilic f. acidophilum is allowed to flourish.
