a straw-man proposal is a brainstormed simple draft proposal intended to generate discussion of its disadvantages and to provoke the generation of new and better proposals. the term is considered american business jargon, but it's also encountered in engineering office culture. sometimes "straw dog" is used instead as form of gender-neutral language. often, a straw man document will be prepared by one or two people prior to kicking off a larger project. in this way, the team can jump start their discussions with a document that is likely to contain many, but not all the key aspects to be discussed. as the document is revised, it may be given other edition names such as the more solid-sounding "stone-man", "iron-man", and so on.
