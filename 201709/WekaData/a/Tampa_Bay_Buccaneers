the tampa bay buccaneers (often shortened as the bucs) are a professional american football franchise based in tampa, florida. the buccaneers currently compete in the national football league (nfl) as a member team of the national football conference (nfc) south division. along with the seattle seahawks, the team joined the nfl in 1976 as an expansion team. the bucs played their first season in the american football conference (afc) west division as part of the 1976 expansion plan, whereby each new franchise would play every other franchise over the first two years. after the season, they switched conferences with the seahawks and became part of the nfc central division. during the 2002 league realignment, the bucs joined three former nfc west teams to form the nfc south. the club is owned by the glazer family, and plays its home games at raymond james stadium in tampa. the buccaneers are the first post-merger expansion team to win a division title, win a playoff game, and to host and play in a conference championship game; all three accomplishments occurred during the 1979 season. they are also the first team since the merger to complete a winning season when starting 10 or more rookies, which happened in the 2010 season. in 1976 and 1977, the buccaneers lost their first 26 games. after a brief winning era in the late 1970s and early 1980s, the team suffered through 14 consecutive losing seasons. then, for a 10-year period, they were consistent playoff contenders and won super bowl xxxvii at the end of the 2002 season, but have not yet returned to the super bowl; thus the bucs, along with the new orleans saints and new york jets, are the only nfl teams to win their lone super bowl appearance. over the course of 39 seasons, the buccaneers have compiled an overall record of 247–395–1, with a regular-season record of 241–386–1 and a playoff record of 6–9.
