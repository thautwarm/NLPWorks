the griqua asteroids are a group of asteroids in the main belt orbiting the sun between 3.1 and 3.27 au. asteroids in this group have eccentricities greater than 0.35. the group derives its name from the asteroid 1362 griqua. these asteroids are at a 2:1 resonance with jupiter's orbit. as such, their orbits are unstable; gradually perturbed over thousands of years until their orbits intersect with that of mars or jupiter.
