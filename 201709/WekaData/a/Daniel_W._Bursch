daniel wheeler bursch (born july 25, 1957) is a former nasa astronaut, and captain of the united states navy. he had four spaceflights, the first three of which were space shuttle missions lasting 10 to 11 days each. his fourth and final spaceflight was a long-duration stay aboard the international space station as a crew member of expedition 4, which lasted from december 2001 to june 2002. this 196-day mission set a new record for the longest duration spaceflight for an american astronaut, a record simultaneously set with his crew mate carl walz. this record has since been broken, and as of 2010 it is held by michael lopez-alegria, who had a 215-day spaceflight as commander of expedition 14.
