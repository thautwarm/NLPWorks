in mathematics, lhs is informal shorthand for the left-hand side of an equation. similarly, rhs is the right-hand side. the two sides have the same value, expressed differently, since equality is symmetric. more generally, these terms may apply to an inequation or inequality; the right-hand side is everything on the right side of a test operator in an expression, with lhs defined similarly.
