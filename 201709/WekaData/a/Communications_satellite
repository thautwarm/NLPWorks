a communications satellite is an artificial satellite that relays and amplifies radio telecommunications signals via a transponder; it creates a communication channel between a source transmitter and a receiver at different locations on earth. communications satellites are used for television, telephone, radio, internet, and military applications. there are over 2,000 communications satellites in earthâ€™s orbit, used by both private and government organizations. wireless communication uses electromagnetic waves to carry signals. these waves require line-of-sight, and are thus obstructed by the curvature of the earth. the purpose of communications satellites is to relay the signal around the curve of the earth allowing communication between widely separated points.communications satellites use a wide range of radio and microwave frequencies. to avoid signal interference, international organizations have regulations for which frequency ranges or "bands" certain organizations are allowed to use. this allocation of bands minimizes the risk of signal interference.
