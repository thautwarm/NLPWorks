in botany, a bud is an undeveloped or embryonic shoot and normally occurs in the axil of a leaf or at the tip of a stem. once formed, a bud may remain for some time in a dormant condition, or it may form a shoot immediately. buds may be specialized to develop flowers or short shoots, or may have the potential for general shoot development. the term bud is also used in zoology, where it refers to an outgrowth from the body which can develop into a new individual.
