mount mikeno is a dormant volcanic mountain located in the democratic republic of the congo section of the virunga mountains along with mount nyiragongo, mount nyamuragira, mount karisimbi, and mount bisoke. at 4,437 metres (14,557 ft) mount mikeno is the second highest peak in the virunga mountains after karisimbi, and the 13th highest mountain of africa. mikeno means "poor" and is so named for its harsh slopes which preclude human habitation. mount mikeno lies completely within virunga national park and is known for the critically endangered mountain gorillas that live on its slopes.  expeditions to observe mikeno's gorillas typically leave from the nearby bukima patrol post.
