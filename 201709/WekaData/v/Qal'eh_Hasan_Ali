qal'eh hasan ali is a maar-producing volcanic field located southeast of kerman province, iran. the field is presumed of quaternary age, though it has produced no historic eruptions. consisting of 14 maars each of different size, its most significant crater is great crater, about 1.2 kilometres (0.75 mi) in width and 200–300 metres (660–980 ft) in depth. this volcanic field was originally considered to be a field of impact craters. the volcanism both of qal'eh hasan ali and of several neighbouring volcanic centres is associated with a local fault zone. the general area of iran has been affected by the collision of arabia with eurasia, resulting in volcanic activity.
