kill doctor lucky is a humorous board game designed by james ernest and released in 1996 by cheapass games. in 1998, kill doctor lucky won the origins award for best abstract board game of 1997. kill doctor lucky is, in concept, a sort of inversion and perhaps a parody of cluedo (clue in north america). both games are set in a sprawling mansion full of colorfully named rooms, feature a variety of dangerous weapons, and deal with the murder of the mansion's owner. cluedo begins after the murder has been committed, and players compete to solve it; kill doctor lucky ends with the murder, and players compete to commit it. in october 2015 a "deluxe 19.5th anniversary edition" with new art and updated game mechanics was launched on kickstarter.
