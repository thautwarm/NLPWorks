the superior petrosal sinus is a venous structure located beneath the brain. it receives blood from the cavernous sinus and passes backward and laterally to drain into the transverse sinus. the sinus runs in the attached margin of the tentorium cerebelli, in a groove in the petrous part of the temporal bone formed by the sinus itself - the superior petrosal sulcus. the sinus receives some cerebellar and inferior cerebral veins, and veins from the tympanic cavity.
