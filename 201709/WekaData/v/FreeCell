freecell is a solitaire-based card game played with a 52-card standard deck. it is fundamentally different from most solitaire games in that very few hands are unsolvable. although software implementations vary, most versions label the hands with a number (derived from the random number seed used to generate the hand). a version of freecell was created by microsoft for release with the windows operating system.
