a venule is a very small blood vessel in the microcirculation that allows blood to return from the capillary beds to drain into the larger blood vessels, the veins. venules range from 7 to 50Î¼m in diameter. veins contain approximately 70% of total blood volume, 25% of which is contained in the venules. many venules unite to form a vein.
