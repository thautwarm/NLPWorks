rakata (/rəˈkɑːtə/ rə-kah-tə) is a collapsed stratovolcano of the indonesian island of krakatoa (indonesian: krakatau) in the sunda strait between the islands of sumatra and java. standing 813 metres (2,667 ft) tall, it was the largest and southernmost of three volcanoes that formed the island krakatoa (the others being danan and perboewatan) and the only one not totally destroyed in the eruption of 1883. rakata did lose its northern half in that eruption, leaving just its southern half. the exposed cliff is quite striking visually, partially of a large exposed dike terminating in a large lenticular extrusion at the middle of the almost vertical cliff. the feature has been called "the eye of krakatoa."
