sumaco is a symmetrical, isolated stratovolcano, that is set off from the main ecuador volcanic axis. its rocks are very distinct from those from most andean volcanoes because of its lack of andesitic composition, in favour of basanite and phonolitic rock. sumaco is heavily forested and contains a small cone in its broad summit crater. an historical eruption occurred around 1895 (Â± 30 years).
