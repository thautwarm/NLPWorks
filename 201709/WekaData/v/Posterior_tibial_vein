in anatomy, there are two posterior tibial veins of the lower limb. they receive blood from the medial and lateral plantar veins and drain the posterior compartment of the leg and the plantar surface of the foot to the popliteal vein which it forms when it joins with the anterior tibial vein. like most deep veins, posterior tibial veins are accompanied by an homonym artery, the posterior tibial artery, along its course. they receive the most important perforator veins: the cockett perforators, superior, medial and inferior.
