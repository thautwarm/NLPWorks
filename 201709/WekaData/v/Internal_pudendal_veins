the internal pudendal veins (internal pudic veins) are a set of veins in the pelvis. they are the venae comitantes of the internal pudendal artery. they begin in the deep veins of the penis which issue from the corpus cavernosum penis, accompany the internal pudendal artery, and unite to form a single vessel, which ends in the internal iliac vein. they receive the veins from the urethral bulb, and the perineal and inferior hemorrhoidal veins. the deep dorsal vein of the penis communicates with the internal pudendal veins, but ends mainly in the pudendal plexus.
