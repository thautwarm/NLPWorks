the goose lake valley is located in south-central oregon and northeastern california in the united states. it is a high valley at the northwestern corner of north america's great basin. much of the valley floor is covered by goose lake, a large endorheic lake that straddles the oregonâ€“california border. native americans inhabited the goose lake valley for thousands of years before explorers arrived in the 19th century. the pioneer wagon route known as the applegate trail crossed the goose lake valley on its way to southern oregon. at the south end of goose lake, the lassen cutoff separated from the applegate trail and headed south toward the sacramento valley. today, lakeview, oregon, is the largest settlement in the valley. livestock ranching and lumber mills are the valley's main commercial activity. the goose lake valley offers a number of recreational opportunities including hang-gliding, hunting, fishing, and birdwatching.
