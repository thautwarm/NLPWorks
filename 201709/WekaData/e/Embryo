an embryo is an early stage of development of a multicellular diploid eukaryotic organism. in general, in organisms that reproduce sexually, an embryo develops from a zygote, the single cell resulting from the fertilization of the female egg cell by the male sperm cell. the zygote possesses half the dna of each of its two parents. in plants, animals, and some protists, the zygote will begin to divide by mitosis to produce a multicellular organism. the result of this process is an embryo. in humans, a pregnancy is generally considered to be in the embryonic stage of development between the fifth and the eleventh weeks after fertilization, and is expressed as a fetus from the twelfth week.
