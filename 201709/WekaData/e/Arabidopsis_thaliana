arabidopsis thaliana (/ərˌæbᵻˈdɒpsɪsˌθɑːliˈɑːnə/ thale cress, mouse-ear cress or arabidopsis) is a small flowering plant native to eurasia. a. thaliana is considered a weed; it is found by roadsides and in disturbed lands. a winter annual with a relatively short life cycle, arabidopsis is a popular model organism in plant biology and genetics. for a complex multicellular eukaryote, a. thaliana has a relatively small genome of approximately 135 megabase pairs (mbp). it was the first plant to have its genome sequenced, and is a popular tool for understanding the molecular biology of many plant traits, including flower development and light sensing. in 2016, it was named as one of the organisms that would be involved in crispr-based genetic engineering.
