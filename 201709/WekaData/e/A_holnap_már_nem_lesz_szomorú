"a holnap már nem lesz szomorú" ("sadness will be over tomorrow") was the hungarian entry in the eurovision song contest 1998, performed in hungarian by charlie. the song was performed eleventh on the night (following malta's chiara with the one that i love and preceding slovenia's vili resnik with naj bogovi slišijo). at the close of voting, it had received 4 points, placing 23rd in a field of 25. the song is a ballad, with charlie singing to an ill lover that she will recover and telling her about the things they will do together when she does. an english version was recorded and the title for it was taken from the direct translation of the hungarian title, "sadness will be over tomorrow", even though this exact phrase does not appear in the english version. the hungarian title does appear in the hungarian version. the same happened with the next hungarian entry, forogj, világ! due to the rapidly expanding numbers involved in the contest, the decision was taken to restrict participation in the 1999 contest to those countries with the best records over the previous five years, a group which did not include hungary. in fact, hungary then opted out of all subsequent contests from 2000 to 2004, before contributing an entry for the 2005 contest. thus, the song was succeeded as hungarian representative at that contest by nox with "forogj, világ!".
