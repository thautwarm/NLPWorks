"elle était si jolie" (english translation: "she was so pretty") was the french entry in the eurovision song contest 1963, performed in french by alain barrière. the song was performed eleventh on the night (following switzerland's esther ofarim with "t'en va pas" and preceding spain's josé guardiola with "algo prodigioso"). at the close of voting, it had received 25 points, placing 5th in a field of 16. the song is a ballad, with barrière reminiscing about a girl he used to know and how pretty she was. her beauty was apparently so much that he could not love her. barrière also recorded the song in german and italian, as "du gingst fort ohne abschied" and "era troppo carina" respectively. the song was well received in latin america, particularly in chile. it was succeeded as french representative at the 1964 contest by rachel with "le chant de mallory".
