a blastocoel is a fluid-filled cavity that forms in the animal hemisphere of early amphibian and echinoderm embryos, or between the epiblast and hypoblast of avian, reptilian, and mammalian blastoderm-stage embryos. a blastocoel (alt. spelling blastocoele, blastocele) is also termed the blastocyst cavity (or cleavage or segmentation cavity) is the name given to the fluid-filled cavity of the blastula (blastocyst) that results from cleavage of the oocyte (ovum) after fertilization. it forms during embryogenesis, as what has been termed a "third stage" after the single-celled fertilized oocyte (zygote, ovum) has divided into 16-32 cells, via the process of mitosis. it can be described as the first cell cavity formed as the embryo enlarges, the essential precursor for the differentiated, topologically distinct, gastrula
