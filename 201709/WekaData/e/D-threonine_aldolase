d-threonine aldolase (ec 4.1.2.42, d-ta, dta, low specificity d-ta, low specificity d-threonine aldolase) is an enzyme with systematic name d-threonine acetaldehyde-lyase (glycine-forming). this enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction (1) d-threonine glycine + acetaldehyde (2) d-allothreonine glycine + acetaldehyde this pyridoxal-phosphate protein is activated by divalent metal cations (e.g. co2+, ni2+, mn2+ or mg2+).
