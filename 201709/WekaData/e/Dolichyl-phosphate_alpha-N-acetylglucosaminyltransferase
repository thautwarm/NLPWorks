in enzymology, a dolichyl-phosphate alpha-n-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (ec 2.4.1.153) is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction udp-n-acetyl-d-glucosamine + dolichyl phosphate udp + dolichyl n-acetyl-alpha-d-glucosaminyl phosphate thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are udp-n-acetyl-d-glucosamine and dolichyl phosphate, whereas its two products are udp and dolichyl n-acetyl-alpha-d-glucosaminyl phosphate. this enzyme belongs to the family of glycosyltransferases, specifically the hexosyltransferases. the systematic name of this enzyme class is udp-n-acetyl-d-glucosamine:dolichyl-phosphate alpha-n-acetyl-d-glucosaminyltransferase. other names in common use include uridine diphosphoacetylglucosamine-dolichol phosphate, acetylglucosaminyltransferase, dolichyl phosphate acetylglucosaminyltransferase, dolichyl phosphate n-acetylglucosaminyltransferase, udp-n-acetylglucosamine-dolichol phosphate, and n-acetylglucosaminyltransferase.
