malate dehydrogenase (ec 1.1.1.37) (mdh) is an enzyme that reversibly catalyzes the oxidation of malate to oxaloacetate using the reduction of nad+ to nadh. this reaction is part of many metabolic pathways, including the citric acid cycle. other malate dehydrogenases, which have other ec numbers and catalyze other reactions oxidizing malate, have qualified names like malate dehydrogenase (nadp+). malate dehydrogenase is also involved in gluconeogenesis, the synthesis of glucose from smaller molecules. pyruvate in the mitochondria is acted upon by pyruvate carboxylase to form oxaloacetate, a citric acid cycle intermediate. in order to get the oxaloacetate out of the mitochondria, malate dehydrogenase reduces it to malate, and it then traverses the inner mitochondrial membrane. once in the cytosol, the malate is oxidized back to oxaloacetate by cytosolic malate dehydrogenase. finally, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (pepck) converts oxaloacetate to phosphoenolpyruvate (pep).
