aldolase a (aldoa, or alda), also known as fructose-bisphosphate aldolase, is an enzyme that in humans is encoded by the aldoa gene on chromosome 16. the protein encoded by this gene is a glycolytic enzyme that catalyzes the reversible conversion of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate and dihydroxyacetone phosphate. three aldolase isozymes (a, b, and c), encoded by three different genes, are differentially expressed during development. aldolase a is found in the developing embryo and is produced in even greater amounts in adult muscle. aldolase a expression is repressed in adult liver, kidney and intestine and similar to aldolase c levels in brain and other nervous tissue. aldolase a deficiency has been associated with myopathy and hemolytic anemia. alternative splicing and alternative promoter usage results in multiple transcript variants. related pseudogenes have been identified on chromosomes 3 and 10.
