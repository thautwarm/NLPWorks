malate dehydrogenase (decarboxylating) (ec 1.1.1.39) or nad-malic enzyme (nad-me) is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction (s)-malate + nad+ pyruvate + co2 + nadh thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are (s)-malate and nad+, whereas its three products are pyruvate, co2, and nadh. malate is oxidized to pyruvate and co2, and nad+ is reduced to nadh. this enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, to be specific, those acting on the ch-oh group of donor with nad+ or nadp+ as acceptor. the systematic name of this enzyme class is (s)-malate:nad+ oxidoreductase (decarboxylating). this enzyme participates in pyruvate metabolism and carbon fixation. nad-malic enzyme is one of three decarboxylation enzymes used in the inorganic carbon concentrating mechanisms of c4 and cam plants. the others are nadp-malic enzyme and pep carboxykinase.
