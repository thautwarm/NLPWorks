fructose-bisphosphate aldolase (ec 4.1.2.13), often just aldolase, is an enzyme catalyzing a reversible reaction that splits the aldol, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, into the triose phosphates dihydroxyacetone phosphate (dhap) and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (g3p). aldolase can also produce dhap from other (3s,4r)-ketose 1-phosphates such as fructose 1-phosphate and sedoheptulose 1,7-bisphosphate. gluconeogenesis and the calvin cycle, which are anabolic pathways, use the reverse reaction. glycolysis, a catabolic pathway, uses the forward reaction. aldolase is divided into two classes by mechanism.
