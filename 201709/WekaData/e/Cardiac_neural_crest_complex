the cardiac neural crest complex is a form of neural crest. the cardiac neural crest develops from the dorsal neural tube. it overlaps the vagal neural crest and migrates to populate the pharyngeal arches 3, 4 and 6 (producing structures in the head) and to the heart, forming connective tissue that separates the great vessels of the heart. other migration locations: 
* into the pharyngeal arches and truncus arteriosus (embryology), forming the aorticopulmonary septum and the smooth muscle of great arteries. 
* anterior of the aorta to become the four pre-aortic ganglia (celiac ganglion, superior mesenteric ganglion, inferior mesenteric ganglion and aortical renal ganglia) notch2 plays an important role in development.
