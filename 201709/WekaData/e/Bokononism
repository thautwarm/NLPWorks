bokononism (/ˈboʊkoʊnɒnˌɪzəm/) is a fictitious religion invented by kurt vonnegut and practiced by many of the characters in his novel cat's cradle. many of the sacred texts of bokononism were written in the form of calypsos. bokononism is based on the concept of foma, which are defined as harmless untruths. a foundation of bokononism is that the religion, including its texts, is formed entirely of lies; however, one who believes and adheres to these lies will have peace of mind, and perhaps live a good life. the primary tenet of bokononism is to "live by the foma that make you brave and kind and healthy and happy."
