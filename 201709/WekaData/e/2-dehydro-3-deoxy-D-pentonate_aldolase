in enzymology, a 2-dehydro-3-deoxy-d-pentonate aldolase (ec 4.1.2.28) is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction 2-dehydro-3-deoxy-d-pentonate pyruvate + glycolaldehyde hence, this enzyme has one substrate, 2-dehydro-3-deoxy-d-pentonate, and two products, pyruvate and glycolaldehyde. this enzyme belongs to the family of lyases, specifically the aldehyde-lyases, which cleave carbon-carbon bonds. the systematic name of this enzyme class is 2-dehydro-3-deoxy-d-pentonate glycolaldehyde-lyase (pyruvate-forming). other names in common use include 2-keto-3-deoxy-d-pentonate aldolase, 3-deoxy-d-pentulosonic acid aldolase, and 2-dehydro-3-deoxy-d-pentonate glycolaldehyde-lyase. this enzyme participates in pentose and glucuronate interconversions.
