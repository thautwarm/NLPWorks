the mazda z-series is a smaller inline 4-cylinder gasoline engine ranging in displacements from 1.3l to 1.6l. they are the evolution of the cast-iron block b-engine. the z-engine has 16-valves operated by dual overhead camshafts, which are in turn driven by a timing chain. the block of the 98-02 z5, zm and zl engine is cast iron same as the earlier b series of engines. other z engines have aluminum alloy block and head, with cast-iron cylinder liners. the block features split upper and lower block assembly for added strength and rigidity, special long intake manifold for added torque, s-vt continuous variable valve timing, and a stainless steel 4:1 exhaust header. as of 2011, mazda will cease to develop the z-engine, to be replaced by the skyactiv p-engine.
