jean-baptiste say (french: [ʒãbatist sɛ]; 5 january 1767 – 15 november 1832) was a french economist and businessman. he had classically liberal views and argued in favor of competition, free trade, and lifting restraints on business. he is best known for say's law, also known as the law of markets, which he popularized. scholars disagree on the surprisingly subtle question of whether it was say who first stated what we now call say's law.
