"lass ihn" ("let him"), was the swiss entry at the eurovision song contest 1998 in birmingham, united kingdom. the song was sung by gunvor, who wore a sleeveless, glittering dark red dress for her eurovision appearance. the song was an ultimatum to a man who had frequently cheated on her, telling him to leave her for good. the song performed fifth on the night, following spain's mikel herzog with "¿qué voy a hacer sin ti?" and preceding slovakia's katarína hasprová with "modlitba". at the close of the voting it had received no points placing last in a field of 25. it was succeeded as swiss representative by jane bogaert with "la vita cos'è?" at the eurovision song contest 2000, having been relegated from the 1999 contest after their poor placing by gunvor.
