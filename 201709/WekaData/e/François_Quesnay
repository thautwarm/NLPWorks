françois quesnay (french: [fʁɑ̃swa kɛnɛ]; june 4, 1694 – december 16, 1774) was a french economist of the physiocratic school. he is known for publishing the "tableau économique" (economic table) in 1758, which provided the foundations of the ideas of the physiocrats. this was perhaps the first work attempting to describe the workings of the economy in an analytical way, and as such can be viewed as one of the first important contributions to economic thought. his le despotisme de la chine, written in 1767, describes chinese politics and society, and his own political support for constitutional oriental despotism.
