in enzymology, a deoxyribose-phosphate aldolase (ec 4.1.2.4) is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction 2-deoxy-d-ribose 5-phosphate d-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate + acetaldehyde hence, this enzyme has one substrate, 2-deoxy-d-ribose 5-phosphate, and two products, d-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate and acetaldehyde. this enzyme belongs to the family of lyases, specifically the aldehyde-lyases, which cleave carbon-carbon bonds. the systematic name of this enzyme class is 2-deoxy-d-ribose-5-phosphate acetaldehyde-lyase (d-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate-forming). other names in common use include phosphodeoxyriboaldolase, deoxyriboaldolase, deoxyribose-5-phosphate aldolase, 2-deoxyribose-5-phosphate aldolase, and 2-deoxy-d-ribose-5-phosphate acetaldehyde-lyase. this enzyme participates in pentose phosphate pathway.
