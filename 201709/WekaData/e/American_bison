the american bison (bison bison), also commonly known as the american buffalo or simply buffalo, is a north american species of bison that once roamed the grasslands of north america in massive herds. they became nearly extinct by a combination of commercial hunting and slaughter in the 19th century and introduction of bovine diseases from domestic cattle, and have made a recent resurgence largely restricted to a few national parks and reserves. their historical range roughly comprised a triangle between the great bear lake in canada's far northwest, south to the mexican states of durango and nuevo león, and east to the atlantic seaboard of the united states (nearly to the atlantic tidewater in some areas) from new york to georgia and per some sources down to florida. bison were seen in north carolina near buffalo ford on the catawba river as late as 1750. two subspecies or ecotypes have been described: the plains bison (b. b. bison), smaller in size and with a more rounded hump, and the wood bison (b. b. athabascae)—the larger of the two and having a taller, square hump. furthermore, the plains bison has been suggested to consist of a northern (b. b. montanae) and a southern subspecies, bringing the total to three. however, this is generally not supported. the wood bison is one of the largest wild species of bovid in the world, surpassed by only the asian gaur and wild water buffalo. it is the largest extant land animal in the americas. the american bison is the national mammal of the united states.
