the 1948 winter olympics, officially known as the v olympic winter games (french: les ves jeux olympiques d'hiver) (german: olympische winterspiele 1948) (italian: v giochi olimpici invernali) (romansh: gieus olimpics d'enviern 1948), was a winter multi-sport event celebrated in 1948 in st. moritz, switzerland. the games were the first to be celebrated after world war ii; it had been 12 years since the last winter games in 1936. from the selection of a host city in a neutral country to the exclusion of japan and germany, the political atmosphere of the post-war world was inescapable during the games. the organizing committee faced several challenges due to the lack of financial and human resources consumed by the war. these were the first of two winter olympic games under the ioc presidency of sigfrid edstr√∂m. there were 28 nations that marched in the opening ceremonies on january 30, 1948. nearly 670 athletes competed in 22 events in four sports. the games also featured two demonstration sports: military patrol, which later became the biathlon, and winter pentathlon, which was discontinued after these games. notable performances were turned in by figure skaters dick button and barbara ann scott and skier henri oreiller. most of the athletic venues were already in existence from the first time st. moritz hosted the winter games in 1928. all of the venues were outdoors, which meant the games were heavily dependent on favorable weather conditions.
