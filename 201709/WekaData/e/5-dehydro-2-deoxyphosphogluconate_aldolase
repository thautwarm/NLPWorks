in enzymology, a 5-dehydro-2-deoxyphosphogluconate aldolase (ec 4.1.2.29) is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction 5-dehydro-2-deoxy-d-gluconate 6-phosphate glycerone phosphate + malonate semialdehyde hence, this enzyme has one substrate, 5-dehydro-2-deoxy-d-gluconate 6-phosphate, and two products, glycerone phosphate and malonate semialdehyde. this enzyme belongs to the family of lyases, specifically the aldehyde-lyases, which cleave carbon-carbon bonds. the systematic name of this enzyme class is 5-dehydro-2-deoxy-d-gluconate-6-phosphate malonate-semialdehyde-lyase (glycerone-phosphate-forming). other names in common use include phospho-5-keto-2-deoxygluconate aldolase, 5-dehydro-2-deoxy-d-gluconate-6-phosphate, and malonate-semialdehyde-lyase.
