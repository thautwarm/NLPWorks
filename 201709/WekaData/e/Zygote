a zygote (from greek ζυγωτός zygōtos "joined" or "yoked", from ζυγοῦν zygoun "to join" or "to yoke"), is a eukaryotic cell formed by a fertilization event between two gametes. the zygote's genome is a combination of the dna in each gamete, and contains all of the genetic information necessary to form a new individual. in multicellular organisms, the zygote is the earliest developmental stage. in single-celled organisms, the zygote can divide asexually by mitosis to produce identical offspring. oscar hertwig and richard hertwig made some of the first discoveries on animal zygote formation.
