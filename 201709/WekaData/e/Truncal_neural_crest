the truncal neural crest or trunk neural crest is a form of neural crest. the trunk neural crest lies between the vagal and sacral neural crest and gives rise to two groups of cells. one group migrates dorsolateral and populates the skin, forming pigment cells and the other migrates ventrolateral through the anterior sclerotome to become the epinephrine-producing cells of the adrenal gland and the neurons of the sympathetic nervous system. some cells remain in the sclerotome to form the dorsal root ganglia other migration locations: 
* proximal to the spinal cord and line up symmetrically to form the dorsal root ganglia. 
* into the skin to form melanocytes. 
* chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla. 
* near the vertebral column and become sympathetic chain ganglia. differentiation involves bmp/noggin.
