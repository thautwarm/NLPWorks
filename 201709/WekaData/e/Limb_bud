the limb bud is a structure formed early in limb development. as a result of interactions between the ectoderm and underlying mesoderm, formation occurs roughly around the fourth week of development  as mesenchymal cells from the lateral plate mesoderm and the somites begin to proliferate to the point where they create a bulge under the ectodermal cells above. the limb bud remains active throughout much of limb development, and its signaling stimulates formation of another signaling center, the apical ectodermal ridge (aer) as well as formation of the zone of polarizing activity (zpa) within the mesenchyme. the mesenchymal cells of the limb bud, which stimulate aer formation as well as maintain aer activity, determine what type of limb will form. zpa signaling will establish polarity of the limb, as well as sustain proper aer activity.
