"unutamazsın" (english: you can't forget) was the turkish entry to the eurovision song contest 1998, performed in turkish by tüzmen. on the night of the contest, held in birmingham, the united kingdom, the song was performed 24th, following estonia's koit toome with "mere lapsed" and preceding macedonia's vlado janevski with "ne zori, zoro". the song received 25 points, placing 14th in a field of 25. a documentary on bbc one showing behind the scenes of the contest, featured tüzmen trying to keep the song within the three minutes limit in rehearsals. after each attempt he called over to the stagehand for the time and was usually 12 or 15 seconds over the limit, before eventually getting it just under the limit. the song was succeeded as turkish representative at the 1999 contest by tuğba önal with "dön artık".
