the bmw m30 is a straight-6 sohc piston engine which was produced from 1968 to 1994. the first model to use the 2494 cc version of the m30 was the e3 2500. over its 28-year lifespan, the m30 was used in many bmw models. although there was no direct replacement for the m30 engine, effectively the v8 m60 and straight-6 m50 (smaller capacity than the m30, but with dohc) took over from the m30. initially, the engine code was "m06", before it was renamed the m30 in the mid 1980s. the engine has been given the nicknames of 'big six' and 'senior six', following the introduction of the smaller bmw m20 straight-6 in the late 1970s. ward's have rated the m30 as one of the "top engines of the 20th century".
