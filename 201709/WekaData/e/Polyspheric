the polyspheric or poly engines were v8 engines produced by chrysler from 1955 to 1958 as a lower-cost alternatives to the hemi engines. these engines were based on the hemi engines, using the same blocks and crankshaft parts, but completely different cylinder heads, pushrods, exhaust manifolds and pistons. they were called polyspheric or poly engines, because they featured polyspherical-shaped (meaning “more than one sphere”) combustion chambers. these combustion chambers were formed by the two shallow concave domes where the intake and exhaust valve seats were. because these engines needed a less sophisticated rocker setup, with only a single rocker shaft in each head, they were also cheaper and lighter than their hemi counterparts. in the chrysler literature, the poly engines were also called single rocker shaft (srs), while the hemi engines were called dual rocker shaft (drs). these engines replaced chrysler's flathead inline six in the division's lower-priced cars, but were slowly replaced by the chrysler a engine, beginning in mid-1956.
