parenting or child rearing is the process of promoting and supporting the physical, emotional, social, financial, and intellectual development of a child from infancy to adulthood. parenting refers to the aspects of raising a child aside from the biological relationship. the most common caretaker in parenting is the biological parent(s) of the child in question, although others may be an older sibling, a grandparent, a legal guardian, aunt, uncle or other family member, or a family friend. governments and society may have a role in child-rearing as well. in many cases, orphaned or abandoned children receive parental care from non-parent blood relations. others may be adopted, raised in foster care, or placed in an orphanage. parenting skills vary, and a parent with good parenting skills may be referred to as a good parent. the english pediatrician and psychoanalyst donald winnicott described the concept of "good-enough" parenting in which a minimum of prerequisites for healthy child development are met. winnicott wrote, "the good-enough mother...starts off with an almost complete adaptation to her infant's needs, and as time proceeds she adapts less and less completely, gradually, according to the infant's growing ability to deal with her failure." views on the characteristics that make one a good or "good-enough" parent vary from culture to culture. additionally, research has supported that parental history both in terms of attachments of varying quality as well as parental psychopathology, particularly in the wake of adverse experiences, can strongly influence parental sensitivity and child outcomes.
