a referendum (in some countries synonymous with a plebiscite â€” or a vote on a ballot question) is a direct vote in which an entire electorate is asked to vote on a particular proposal. this may result in the adoption of a new law. some definitions of 'plebiscite' suggest that it is a type of vote to change the constitution or government of a country. however, some other countries define it differently. for example, australia defines 'referendum' as a vote to change the constitution, and 'plebiscite' as a vote that does not affect the constitution. in contrast, ireland has only ever held one plebiscite, which was the vote to adopt its constitution, and every other vote has been called a referendum.
