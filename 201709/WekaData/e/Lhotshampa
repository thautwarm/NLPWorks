the lhotshampa or lhotsampa (nepali: ल्होत्साम्पा; tibetan: ལྷོ་མཚམས་པ་, wylie: lho-mtshams-pa) people are a heterogeneous bhutanese people of nepalese descent. the lhotshampa people are native to southern bhutan, and are thus colloquially referred to as southerners. starting in 2007, most of the lhotshampas, or bhutanese refugees, were resettled to third countries, such as the united states, canada, australia, the united kingdom, and other european countries. today, the number of lhotshampa in nepal are significantly lower than that in united states, and other countries where they were resettled. since then, bhutanese people of nepalese origin started to settle in uninhabited areas of southern bhutan.
