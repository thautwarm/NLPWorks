a multicast address is a logical identifier for a group of hosts in a computer network that are available to process datagrams or frames intended to be multicast for a designated network service. multicast addressing can be used in the link layer (layer 2 in the osi model), such as ethernet multicast, and at the internet layer (layer 3 for osi) for internet protocol version 4 (ipv4) or version 6 (ipv6) multicast.
