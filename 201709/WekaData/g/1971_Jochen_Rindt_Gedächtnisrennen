the jochen rindt gedächtnisrennen or the vi rhein-pokalrennen was a motor race, run to formula one rules, held on 13 june 1971 at the hockenheimring, germany. the race was run over 35 laps of the circuit, and was dominated by belgian driver jacky ickx in a ferrari 312b. the race was arranged after the belgian grand prix of 1971 was cancelled, in order to fill the gap between the monaco grand prix and the dutch grand prix. the german grand prix had moved to the nürburgring, so the hockenheim circuit was chosen for the race, which was also a memorial race for jochen rindt, the reigning world champion who had been killed at the 1970 italian grand prix. on the same weekend, the 1971 24 hours of le mans was being held, so several of the regular formula one drivers were absent from this race, including chris amon, jean-pierre beltoise, henri pescarolo, pedro rodríguez and jo siffert. there were other absentees: jackie stewart and denny hulme were racing the labatt's 200 can-am race, and emerson fittipaldi was recovering from a road accident. of the regular formula one teams, matra were at le mans, brabham were still repairing graham hill's car after an accident in monaco, and tyrrell elected not to take part. scuderia ferrari had entered a car for mario andretti but he missed the race after suffering burns in an accident in the usa. as a tribute to rindt, pole position on the grid was left vacant, leaving polesitter ickx alone on the front row, taking the second slot.
