melody is a hybrid white wine grape variety produced from a cross of seyval blanc and a grape called geneva white 5, which is itself a cross between pinot blanc and ontario. melody produces a light white with notes of peach and honeysuckle, and refreshing acidity, even at low sugar levels (0.7%-0.6% rs). the grape is noted for its resistance to powdery mildew and botrytis, although downy mildew has been noted on leaves and clusters. it grows well in both sandy and clay loam
