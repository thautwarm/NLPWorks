the japan golf tour is a prominent golf tour. it was founded in 1973 and as of 2006 it offers the third highest annual prize fund out of the regular (that is not for seniors) men's professional tours after the pga tour and the european tour. however, since the early 1990s, the growth in prize money has not kept pace with that on the two larger tours. official events on the japan golf tour count for world golf ranking points, and success on the tour can also qualify members to play in the majors. most of the leading players on the tour are japanese, but players from many other countries also participate. the tour is currently run by the japan golf tour organization (jgto), which was established in 1999. the jgto also organises a developmental tour called the japan challenge tour. masashi "jumbo" ozaki has been the dominant player on tour, leading the career wins list with 94, the career money list with over Â¥2 billion, and winning the money title twelve times between 1973 and 1998.
