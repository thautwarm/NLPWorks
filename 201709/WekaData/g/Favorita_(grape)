favorita is a white italian wine grape grown primarily in the piedmont region. it is most widely planted on the left bank of the tanaro river in the roero district near alba, though some plantings exist on the right bank of the tanaro in the langhe hills. recent dna profiling shows that favorita is related to the liguria grapes pigato and vermentino, which may support the theory that the grape originated there. since the late 20th century, plantings of favorita have been on the decline as chardonnay and arneis have increased in popularity among producers on the right and left bank of the tanaro respectively. featuring larger berry sizes than most wine grapes, favorita has been a popular table grape in piedmont.
