a barred spiral galaxy is a spiral galaxy with a central bar-shaped structure composed of stars. bars are found in approximately two-thirds of all spiral galaxies. bars generally affect both the motions of stars and interstellar gas within spiral galaxies and can affect spiral arms as well. the milky way galaxy, where our own solar system is located, is classified as a barred spiral galaxy. edwin hubble classified spiral galaxies of this type as "sb" (spiral, barred) in his hubble sequence, and arranged them into sub-categories based on how open the arms of the spiral are. sba types feature tightly bound arms, while sbc types are at the other extreme and have loosely bound arms. sbb-type galaxies lie in between. sb0 is a barred lenticular galaxy. a new type, sbm, was subsequently created to describe somewhat irregular barred spirals, such as the magellanic cloud galaxies, which were once classified as irregular galaxies, but have since been found to contain barred spiral structures. among other types in hubble's classifications for the galaxies are: spiral galaxy, elliptical galaxy and irregular galaxy.
