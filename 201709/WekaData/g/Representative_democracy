representative democracy (also indirect democracy, representative republic, or psephocracy) is a type of democracy founded on the principle of elected officials representing a group of people, as opposed to direct democracy. all modern western-style democracies are types of representative democracies; for example, the united kingdom is a crowned republic and ireland is a parliamentary republic. representative democracy is often presented as the only form of democracy possible in mass societies. it arguably allows for efficient ruling by a sufficiently small number of people on behalf of the larger number. representative democracy has been conceptually associated with and historically instantiated by the political system known as "representative government," which was born in the 18th century with the french and american revolutions. it is a system in which people elect their lawmakers (representatives), who are then held accountable to them for their activity within government. it is an element of both the parliamentary system or presidential system of government and is typically used in a lower chamber such as the house of commons (uk) or dáil éireann (ireland), and may be curtailed by constitutional constraints such as an upper chamber. it has been described by some political theorists including robert a dahl, gregory houston and ian liebenberg as polyarchy. in it the power is in the hands of the elected representatives who are elected by the people in elections.
