the original dixieland jass band (odjb) was a dixieland jazz band that made the first jazz recordings in early 1917. their "livery stable blues" became the first jazz single ever issued. the group made the first recordings, and claimed authorship, of many jazz standards, the most famous being "tiger rag". in late 1917 the spelling of the band's name was changed to original dixieland jazz band. the band consisted of five musicians who had played in the papa jack laine bands, a racially integrated group of musicians who played for parades, dances, and advertising in new orleans. odjb billed itself as the "creators of jazz". it was the first band to record jazz commercially and to have hit recordings in the new genre. band leader and trumpeter nick larocca argued that odjb deserved recognition as the first band to record jazz commercially and the first band to establish jazz as a musical idiom or genre.
