the 2010 open championship was held 15â€“18 july over the old course at st andrews, fife, scotland. it was the 150th anniversary of the founding of the open in 1860, and the 28th time the open was played at st andrews. while the tournament is usually branded with the edition of the championship (for example, the previous year's open was branded as the "138th open championship"), due to the special anniversary the r&a branded this tournament as the "150th anniversary open championship", instead of using what would have been the normal "139th open championship" branding. the standard branding returned the following year. louis oosthuizen won his first major championship victory, with a 16-under-par total of 272, seven strokes clear of runner-up lee westwood. paul casey, rory mcilroy and henrik stenson finished a further stroke behind.
