cordevalle, a rosewood resort is a private golf course and spa resort near san martin, california, southeast of san jose. operated by rosewood hotels & resorts, it is located in the santa clara valley, near the eastern edge of the santa cruz mountains. the club's 1996 permit required that 60% of the golf rounds played be reserved for the general public, but the club defines "general public" as including guests of members. in the resulting dispute with the county planning commission, the club agreed to create a youth golf foundation, to pay for underprivileged youths to learn the game of golf at cordevalle or elsewhere. in exchange, the planning commission agreed to waive the requirement for 60% public play. nancy pelosi, the minority leader of the u.s. house, owns approximately $1,000,000 worth of the club.
