arp 273 is a group of interacting galaxies, lying 300 million light years away in the constellation andromeda. it was first described in the atlas of peculiar galaxies, compiled by halton arp in 1966. the larger of the spiral galaxies, known as ugc 1810, is about five times more massive than the smaller galaxy. it has a disc that is tidally distorted into a rose-like shape by the gravitational pull of the companion galaxy below it, known as ugc 1813. the smaller galaxy shows distinct signs of active star formation at its nucleus, and "it is thought that the smaller galaxy has actually passed through the larger one."
