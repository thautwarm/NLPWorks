neurofunk (also known more informally as just neuro) is a subgenre of drum and bass which emerged between 1997 and 1998 in london, england as a progression of techstep. it was further developed by juxtaposed elements of heavier and harder forms of funk with multiple influences ranging from techno, house and jazz, distinguished by consecutive stabs over the bassline and razor-sharp backbeats. the first sounds of neurofunk's early evolution - when diverging from techstep - can be heard on ed rush and optical's funktion single for v recordings in 1997 and on their first album wormhole  for virus recordings in 1998. the first mention of the term was in the book energy flash: a journey through rave music and dance culture by simon reynolds. this is where the english music critic coined the name as a result of his personal perception of stylistic shifts in techstep - back beats replacing breakbeats, funk harmonies replacing industrial timbres and lack of emphasis on the drop - by referring to them as, "(neurofunk) is the fun-free culmination of jungle's strategy of cultural resistance: the eroticization of anxiety".
