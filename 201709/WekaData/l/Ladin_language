(not to be confused with ladino language or latin.) ladin (/læˈdiːn/ or /ləˈdiːn/; ladin: ladin, italian: ladino, german: ladinisch) is a romance language consisting of a group of dialects (which some consider part of a unitary rhaeto-romance language) mainly spoken in the dolomite mountains in northern italy in south tyrol, the trentino and the province of belluno by the ladin people. it exhibits similarities to swiss romansh and friulian. the precise extension of the ladin language area is the subject of scholarly debates. a more narrow perspective includes only the dialects of the valleys around the sella group, wider definitions comprise the dialects of adjacent valleys in the province of belluno and even dialects spoken in the northwestern trentino. a standard written variety of ladin (ladin dolomitan) has been developed by the office for ladin language planning as a common communication tool across the whole ladin-speaking region, but it is not popular among ladin speakers. ladin should not be confused with ladino (also called judeo-spanish), which, although also romance, is derived from old spanish.
