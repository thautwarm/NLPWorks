ker v. illinois, 119 u.s. 436 (1886), is a u.s. supreme court case. it held that a fugitive kidnapped from abroad could not claim any violation of the constitution, laws or treaties of the united states. the incident that led to this decision involved with a pinkerton detective agency agent, henry julian, was hired by the federal government to collect a larcenist, frederick ker, who had fled to peru. although julian had the necessary extradition papers—the two governments had negotiated an extradition treaty a decade earlier—he found that there was no official to meet his request due to the recent chilean military occupation of lima. rather than return home empty-handed, julian kidnapped the fugitive, with assistance from chilean forces, and placed him on a u.s. vessel heading back to the united states.
