the great lakes lacrosse league (glll) is a regional organization of non-varsity men's club field lacrosse programs in the midwestern united states. the glll was founded in 2004 to provide a competitive league for teams in the midwest who want to play in a well-organized league outside of ncaa restrictions and without the expense of being a "virtual varsity." the glll has grown to 44 teams, from eight different states including: illinois, indiana, iowa, michigan, minnesota, north dakota, south dakota, and wisconsin. the league is divided into six geographic divisions. members of the glll strive to find a greater balance between athletics, personal life and academics. the season culminates each year with a championship tournament.
