the nbr c class (lner class j36) is a class of 0-6-0 steam locomotive designed by matthew holmes for freight work on the north british railway. they were introduced in 1888 and had inside cylinders and stephenson valve gear. a total of 168 locomotives was built, of which 123 came into british railways ownership at nationalisation in 1948. this was the last class of steam engine in service in scotland. the nbr c class (lner class j32) is a class of 0-6-0 steam locomotive designed by dugald drummond for freight work on the north british railway. they were built in 1876 and 1877 and had large 18" cylinders. a total of 32 locomotives was built. the nbr gave these engines the same designation (c class) as the matthew holmes engines above. the two types were very similar, and shared the same (then unusual) 18" cylinder size. between 1898 and 1903 matthew holmes had all 32 of the drummond locomotives rebuilt to match his own c class design. thus the locomotives were considered a single class by the nbr, although on passing to lner ownership they received the separate designations of j36 and j32 respectively.
