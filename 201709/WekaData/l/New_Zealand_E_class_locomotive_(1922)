the new zealand e class battery-electric locomotive represented the third unique type of locomotive class to be given the e classification in new zealand. the first was the e class of nine double fairlie steam locomotives of 1872-75; the second e class consisted of a mallet compound made in 1906; and as both were no longer operated by the new zealand railways department in 1923, the classification was free to be used for a third time when the small battery electric locomotive was delivered. this is the only time a classification has been used three times in new zealand, though re-use happened a number of other times, arguably most notably when the a class of 1906 took the designation originally used by the a class of 1873.
