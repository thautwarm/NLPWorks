the men's collegiate lacrosse association (mcla) is a national organization of non-ncaa, men's college lacrosse programs. the mcla oversees game play and conducts national championships for over 200 teams in ten conferences throughout the united states and canada. the mcla provides a governing structure much like the ncaa, with eligibility rules, all-americans and a national tournament to decide national champions in both divisions i and ii. the mcla exists to provide a quality college lacrosse experience where varsity ncaa lacrosse does not exist. on an individual scale, the mcla provides rules and a structure that promotes "virtual varsity" lacrosse, or an experience paralleling that of ncaa programs. while the mcla provides a high level of athletic competition, it is one of the few governing bodies that does not have a national gpa requirement for its athletes. on a national scale, the mcla provides the infrastructure to support a level playing field through eligibility rules and enforcement and the use of ncaa rules of play. the mcla, an organization governing a mere 70 teams in 1997, has seen a rapid growth in affiliation as national interest in the sport of lacrosse continues to increase. as of the 2014 season, participation has increased to 210 teams.
