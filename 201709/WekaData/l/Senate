a senate is a deliberative assembly, often the upper house or chamber of a bicameral legislature or parliament. the name comes from the ancient roman senate (latin: senatus), so-called as an assembly of the senior (latin: senex meaning "the elder" or "the old one") and therefore allegedly wiser and more experienced members of the society or ruling class. thus, the literal meaning of the word "senate" is: assembly of elders. many countries have an assembly named a senate, composed of senators who may be elected, appointed, have inherited the title, or gained membership by other methods, depending on the country. modern senates typically serve to provide a chamber of "sober second thought" to consider legislation passed by a lower house, whose members are usually elected.
