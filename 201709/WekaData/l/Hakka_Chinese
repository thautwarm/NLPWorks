hakka /ˈhækə/, also rendered kejia, is one of the major groups of varieties of chinese, spoken natively by the hakka people in southern china, taiwan, hong kong and throughout the diaspora areas of east asia, southeast asia, and around the world. due to its primary usage in scattered isolated regions where communication is limited to the local area, hakka has developed numerous varieties or dialects, spoken in guangdong, fujian, jiangxi, guangxi, sichuan, hunan, and guizhou provinces, including hainan island, malaysia, hong kong, singapore and taiwan. hakka is not mutually intelligible with mandarin, wu, southern min, or other branches of chinese. it is most closely related to gan and is sometimes classified as a variety of gan. taiwan, where hakka is the native language of a significant minority of the island's residents, is an important world center for study and preservation of the language. pronunciation differences exist between the taiwanese hakka dialect and china's guangdong hakka dialect; even in taiwan, two local varieties of hakka exist. the meixian dialect (moiyen) of northeast guangdong in china has been taken as the "standard" dialect by the people's republic of china. the guangdong provincial education department created an official romanization of moiyen in 1960, one of four languages receiving this status in guangdong.
