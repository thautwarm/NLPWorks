psophometric voltage is a circuit noise voltage measured with a psophometer that includes a ccif-1951 weighting network. "psophometric voltage" should not be confused with "psophometric emf," i.e., the emf in a generator or line with 600 ω internal resistance. for practical purposes, the psophometric emf is twice the corresponding psophometric voltage. psophometric voltage readings, v, in millivolts, are commonly converted to dbm(psoph) by dbm(psoph) = 20 log10v – 57.78.
