the luigi broglio space centre (bsc) is an italian-owned spaceport near malindi, kenya, named after its founder and italian space pioneer luigi broglio. developed in the 1960s through a partnership between the university of rome la sapienza's aerospace research centre and nasa, the bsc served as a spaceport for the launch of both italian and international satellites (1967-1988). the centre comprises a main offshore launch site, known as the san marco platform, as well as two secondary control platforms and a communications ground station on the mainland. in 2003 a legislative decree handed the italian space agency management of the centre, beginning in 2004, and the name changed from the previous san marco equatorial range. while the ground station is still in use for satellite communications, the bsc is not currently used as a launch site.
