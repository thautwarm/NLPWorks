launch complex 39 (lc-39) is a rocket launch site at the john f. kennedy space center on merritt island in florida, united states. the site and its collection of facilities were originally built for the apollo program, and later modified for the space shuttle program. as of 2016, its launch pads are being modified to support launches of the spacex falcon 9, dragon 2 and falcon heavy, and nasa's space launch system, with a new pad, c, added to support smaller launches. launch complex 39 is composed of three launch padsâ€”,  and , a vehicle assembly building (vab), a crawlerway used by crawler-transporters to carry mobile launcher platforms between the vab and the pads, orbiter processing facility buildings, a launch control center which contains the firing rooms, a news facility famous for the iconic countdown clock seen in television coverage and photos, and various logistical and operational support buildings. spacex leases launch pad 39a from nasa and has modified the pad to support falcon heavy launches in 2016.nasa began modifying launch pad 39b in 2007 to accommodate the now defunct project constellation, and is currently preparing it for the space launch system with first launch scheduled for 2018. pad c was originally planned but never built for apollo. it was constructed from january to june 2015 to accommodate small-class vehicles, to be determined. nasa launches from lc-39a and 39b have been supervised from the nasa launch control center (lcc), located 3 miles (4.8 km) from the launch pads, although it is unclear if spacex will use the lcc for their launches beginning in 2016. lc-39 is one of several launch sites that share radar and tracking services of the eastern test range.
