metafont is a description language used to define vector fonts. it is also the name of the interpreter that executes metafont code, generating the bitmap fonts that can be embedded into e.g. postscript. metafont was devised by donald knuth as a counterpart to his tex typesetting system. one of the characteristics of metafont is that all of the shapes of the glyphs are defined with geometrical equations. in particular, one can define a given point to be the intersection of a line segment and a b√©zier cubic.
