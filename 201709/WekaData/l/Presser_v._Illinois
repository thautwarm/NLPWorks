presser v. illinois, 116 u.s. 252 (1886), was a decision of the supreme court of the united states holding that "unless restrained by their own constitutions, state legislatures may enact statutes to control and regulate all organizations, drilling, and parading of military bodies and associations except those which are authorized by the militia laws of the united states." saying the second amendment to the united states constitution limited only the power of congress and the national government to control firearms, not that of the state and that the right peaceably to assemble was not protected by the clause referred to except to petition the government for a redress of grievances.
