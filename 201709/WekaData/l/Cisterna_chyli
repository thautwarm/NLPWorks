the cisterna chyli (or cysterna chyli, and etymologically more correct, receptaculum chyli) is a dilated sac at the lower end of the thoracic duct into which lymph from the intestinal trunk and two lumbar lymphatic trunks flow. it receives fatty chyle from the intestines and thus acts as a conduit for the lipid products of digestion. it is the most common drainage trunk of most of the body's lymphatics. the cisterna chyli is a retro-peritoneal structure, located posterior to the abdominal aorta on the anterior aspect of the bodies of the first and second lumbar vertebrae (l1 and l2). there it forms the beginning of the primary lymph vessel, the thoracic duct, which transports lymph and chyle from the abdomen via the aortic opening of the diaphragm up to the junction of left subclavian vein and internal jugular veins.
