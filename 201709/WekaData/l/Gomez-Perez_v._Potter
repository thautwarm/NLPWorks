gomez-perez v. potter, 553 u.s. 474 (2008), was a united states supreme court case holding that federal employees can assert claims for retaliation resulting from filing an age discrimination complaint. the case continued the court's long-standing position that cause for action following retaliation can be inferred in civil rights legislation, even though the law does not explicitly provide protection against victimization. the case is important because it signaled a willingness by recently appointed justice samuel alito to continue the court's expansive interpretation of civil rights laws.
