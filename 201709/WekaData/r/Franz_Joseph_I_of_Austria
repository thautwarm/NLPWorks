franz joseph i or francis joseph i (german: franz josef i., hungarian: i. ferenc józsef, croatian: franjo josip i., czech: františek josef i., italian: francesco giuseppe; 18 august 1830 – 21 november 1916) was emperor of austria, and king of hungary, croatia and bohemia from 2 december 1848 until his death on 21 november 1916. from 1 may 1850 to 24 august 1866 he was also president of the german confederation. he was the longest-reigning emperor of austria and the third longest-reigning monarch of any country in european history, after louis xiv of france and johann ii of liechtenstein. in december 1848, emperor ferdinand abdicated the throne at olomouc as part of ministerpräsident felix zu schwarzenberg's plan to end the revolutions of 1848 in austria. this allowed ferdinand's nephew franz joseph to accede to the throne. largely considered to be a reactionary, franz joseph spent his early reign resisting constitutionalism in his domains. the austrian empire was forced to cede its influence over tuscany and most of its claim to lombardy–venetia to the kingdom of piedmont-sardinia, following the second italian war of independence in 1859 and the third italian war of independence in 1866. although franz joseph ceded no territory to the kingdom of prussia after the austrian defeat in the austro-prussian war, the peace of prague (23 august 1866) settled the german question in favour of prussia, which prevented the unification of germany under the house of habsburg (großdeutsche lösung). franz joseph was troubled by nationalism during his entire reign. he concluded the ausgleich of 1867, which granted greater autonomy to hungary, hence transforming the austrian empire into the austro-hungarian empire under his dual monarchy. his domains were then ruled peacefully for the next 45 years, although franz joseph personally suffered the tragedies of the execution of his brother, maximilian in 1867, the suicide of his only son and heir, crown prince rudolf in 1889, and the assassination of his wife, empress elisabeth in 1898. after the austro-prussian war, austria-hungary turned its attention to the balkans, which was a hotspot of international tension due to conflicting interests with the russian empire. the bosnian crisis was a result of franz joseph's annexation of bosnia and herzegovina in 1908, which had been occupied by his troops since the congress of berlin (1878). on 28 june 1914, the assassination of his nephew archduke franz ferdinand in sarajevo resulted in austria-hungary's declaration of war against the kingdom of serbia, which was russia's ally. this activated a system of alliances which resulted in world war i. franz joseph died on 21 november 1916, after ruling his domains for almost 68 years. he was succeeded by his grandnephew charles.
