firehawk is a steel flying roller coaster built by vekoma at kings island in mason, ohio. it originally opened as x-flight at six flags worlds of adventure on may 26, 2001. cedar fair purchased worlds of adventure in 2004 and began efforts to downsize the park. in november 2006, cedar fair announced plans to relocate x-flight. kings island was later revealed as the destination, and it officially reopened as firehawk on may 26, 2007. firehawk may not have been the first flying dutchman model from vekoma, a title that belongs to nighthawk at carowinds, but it was billed as the midwest's first and only flying roller coaster when it opened in 2001. the notability was short-lived, as the opening of superman: ultimate flight at six flags great america two years later meant it was no longer alone in the region. in addition, firehawk's layout is identical to batwing, another vekoma flying dutchman, located at six flags america in upper marlboro, maryland.
