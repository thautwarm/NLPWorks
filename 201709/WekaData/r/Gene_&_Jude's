gene's & jude's or (sic: gene & jude's) is a popular and iconic hot dog stand in river grove, illinois, founded in 1946 by chicago city worker gene mormino. the stand is famous for its limited approach to the chicago-style hot dog, its toppings departing from tradition by including only mustard, onions, relish, sport peppers and fresh cut french fries placed on top, known as a depression dog. the menu is limited to hot dogs, double dogs, tamales and fries, and, atypical of chicago hot dog stands, lacks any trace of ketchup even for dipping the fries.
