physical information security is the intersection, the common ground between physical security and information security. it primarily concerns the protection of tangible information-related assets such as computer systems and storage media against physical, real-world threats such as unauthorized physical access, theft, fire and flood. it typically involves physical controls such as protective barriers and locks, uninterruptible power supplies, and shredders. information security controls in the physical domain complement those in the logical domain (such as encryption), and procedural or administrative controls (such as information security awareness and compliance with policies and laws).
