big game (1939â€“1963) was a british thoroughbred racehorse and sire. in a career that lasted from april 1941 to october 1942, the colt, who was owned by king george vi, ran nine times and won eight races. he was the best british two-year-old colt of his generation in 1941 when he was unbeaten in five starts. two further wins the following spring including the 2000 guineas at newmarket took his unbeaten run to seven, but he suffered his first defeat when odds-on favourite for the wartime "new derby". he won his only other race in the champion stakes before being retired to stud. big game's royal connections and racecourse success made him one of the most popular horses of his time.
