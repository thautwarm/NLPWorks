almannaskarðsgöng is a tunnel along route 1, located near höfn (hornafjörður) in the eastern region of iceland. the tunnel measures exactly 1,312 metres in length (although a sign rounds it off to 1,300 m). it was opened on june 24, 2005. the tunnel passes under the narrow and steep almannaskarð pass, between the hornafjörður and lón fjords. the pass is still accessible in the summer time from the northern ramp (the southwest ramp is closed for public traffic), and there is a parking place with a beautiful view. during the winter the old road had to be closed because of regular snow, impeding traffic to and from the east of iceland, so a new tunnel began construction in march 2004 and was completed in october 2004. the tunnel runs through 1,150 metres of solid rock and some 162 metres of concrete portals, bringing the total length to 1312 metres. the road is two lanes wide, although there are three passing places in the tunnel for emergency traffic. the southern tunnel entrance is located at 39 metres above sea level whilst the northern tunnel entrance is 82 m high, making the incline of the tunnel 4.6%.
