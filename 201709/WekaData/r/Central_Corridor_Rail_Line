the central corridor rail line is a proposed passenger service route between new london, connecticut, and brattleboro, vermont. a primary purpose of the proposed service is to provide a rail link between 13 colleges and universities (including the state flagship schools uconn, umass amherst, and uvm) as part of the knowledge corridor. preparing the line for passenger service would require refurbishing the new england central railroad tracks, which also carry freight to new london's deepwater port. the northernmost section, in vermont, has been upgraded to continuously welded rail via a $50 million arra grant. new england central estimates that similar upgrades (which include upgrading the track to standard 286,000 pound car loads) from the massachusetts / vermont border to new london would cost $18 million, while the full project including stations and rolling stock would cost $150 million.
