vuelta ciclista mexico telmex is an annual road cycling race in mexico that takes place over the course of eight days, involving eight stages. the mexico national tour has a rich history dating back to the 1940s, and this latest incarnation was revived in late 2008 and early 2009 as the condensed evolution of the vueltas de las americas, 21-day stage race, defunct from 2003. this national tour is currently ranked 2.2, according to uci race classifications, and is a part of the uci america tour. title sponsorship is provided via conade (comisión nacional de cultura física y deporte), as well as the telmex foundation, a philanthropic entity created by telmex c.e.o., carlos slim. additional sponsorship has been provided previously by bmw, mercury, coca cola, novosportware, and metalurgica creativa. while 2008 primarily featured non-uci regional mexican teams, with nine such squads, 2009 saw that number shrink to eight, of which arenas and canel's had been uci the year prior and may not have renewed due to the poor global economy. more importantly 2009 featured, for the first time, two uci professional continental teams with serramenti pvc diquigiovanni, and amica chips. also present in each of the first two editions are various north american national squads: 2008 saw the participation of the guatemalan and cuban national teams, and in 2009 the cuban national team returned along with first time appearances by national squads, usa and mexico.
