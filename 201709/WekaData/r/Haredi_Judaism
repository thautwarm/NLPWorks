haredi judaism (hebrew: חֲרֵדִי ḥaredi, ipa: [χaʁeˈdi]; also spelled charedi, plural charedim) is a broad spectrum of groups within orthodox judaism, all characterized by rejection of modern secular culture. its members are often referred to as strictly orthodox or ultra-orthodox in english. the term "ultra-orthodox", however, is considered a derogatory slur by some in the community. haredim regard themselves as the most religiously authentic group of jews, although this claim is contested by other streams. haredi judaism emerged in response to the sweeping changes brought upon the jews in the modern era: emancipation, enlightenment, the haskalah movement derived from enlightenment, acculturation, secularization, religious reform in all its forms from mild to extreme, the rise of the jewish national movement, etc. in contrast to modern orthodox judaism, which hastened to embrace modernity, the approach of the haredim was to maintain a steadfast adherence both to jewish law and custom by segregating themselves from modern society. however, there are haredi communities in which getting a professional degree and a trade is encouraged, and contact exists between haredi and non-haredi jews. haredi communities are primarily found in israel, north america, and western europe. their estimated global population currently numbers 1.3-1.5 million, and, due to a virtual absence of interfaith marriage and a high birth rate, their numbers are growing rapidly. their numbers have also been boosted by a substantial number of secular jews adopting a haredi lifestyle.
