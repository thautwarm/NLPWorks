fresh records was an independent record label, and distributor based in the united kingdom. most popular (and successful) in the early 1980s, the label once supported punk groups like the wall, uk decay, play dead, family fodder, cuddly toys, the dark, wilko johnson and big hair competed with labels such as 4ad. the label ran out of cash and went bankrupt in 1982. staff at the label formed jungle records and bought the rights to the label recordings. a dance label of the same name began in the uk in 1992, supporting artists such as lovestation, strike and serious danger.
