the central connector (formerly called auckland central transit corridor), is a bus rapid transit link (mooted as a potential future light rail route) between britomart transport centre in the auckland cbd, new zealand, and the commercial suburb of newmarket. it is to improve journey times by about 14 minutes for around to 2,600 buses per week, about 65,000 passengers daily. work began in april 2008 and is now finished. in november 2007 john banks, the mayor of auckland city, ordered a review of the project as part of his promised crackdown on rate increases. it was decided to go forward with the project, in part due to it being expected to cost auckland city (according to late 2007 estimates) only nz$8.5 million, with land transport new zealand paying $20.5 million in addition to auckland regional transport authority's (arta) $13.7 million share. banks' first council, before its 2004 defeat by dick hubbard, had also first mooted the project to replace the tramway that was planned under christine fletcher's council but cancelled under banks.
