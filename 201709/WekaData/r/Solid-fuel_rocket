a solid-fuel rocket or solid rocket is a rocket with a rocket engine that uses solid propellants (fuel/oxidizer). the earliest rockets were solid-fuel rockets powered by gunpowder; they were used in warfare by the chinese, indians, mongols and persians, as early as the 13th century. all rockets used some form of solid or powdered propellant up until the 20th century, when liquid-propellant rockets offered more efficient and controllable alternatives. solid rockets are still used today in model rockets and on larger applications for their simplicity and reliability. since solid-fuel rockets can remain in storage for long periods, and then reliably launch on short notice, they have been frequently used in military applications such as missiles. the lower performance of solid propellants (as compared to liquids) does not favor their use as primary propulsion in modern medium-to-large launch vehicles customarily used to orbit commercial satellites and launch major space probes. solids are, however, frequently used as strap-on boosters to increase payload capacity or as spin-stabilized add-on upper stages when higher-than-normal velocities are required. solid rockets are used as light launch vehicles for low earth orbit (leo) payloads under 2 tons or escape payloads up to 500 kilograms (1,100 lb).
