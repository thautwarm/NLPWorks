the martin marietta sm-68a/hgm-25a titan i was the united states' first multistage intercontinental ballistic missile (icbm), in use from 1959 until 1965. incorporating the latest design technology when designed and manufactured, the titan i provided an additional nuclear deterrent to complement the u.s. air force's sm-65 atlas missile. it was the first in a series of titan rockets, but was unique among them in that it used liquid oxygen and rp-1 as propellants, while the later titan icbm versions all used storeable fuels instead. though the sm-68a was operational for only three years, it was an important step in building the air force's strategic nuclear forces.
