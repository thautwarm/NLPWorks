ghayn (ғ ғ; italics: ғ ғ) also known as ge with stroke, or as ayn (in kazakh), is a letter of the cyrillic script. in unicode this letter is called "ghe with stroke". it is used in the bashkir, karakalpak, kazakh, uzbek and tajik languages, where it represents the voiced uvular fricative /ʁ/. despite having a similar shape, it is not related to the latin letter f (f f) or the greek letter digamma (ϝ ϝ). in kazakh and tofa, this letter may also represent the voiced velar fricative /ɣ/. in nivkh, ғ represents /ɣ/, while /ʁ/ is represented by ӻ, which looks like ғ with a hook. the khakas language also uses ғ. in earlier, arabic-alphabet-based orthographies for some of these languages, the same sound was written with the letter ﻍ (ġayn/ghain).
