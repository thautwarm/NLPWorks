commodus (/ˈkɒmədəs/; latin: marcus aurelius commodus antoninus augustus; 31 august 161 ad – 31 december 192 ad) was roman emperor from 180 to 192. he also ruled as co-emperor with his father marcus aurelius from 177 until his father's death in 180. his accession as emperor was the first time a son had succeeded his biological father since titus succeeded vespasian in 79. he was also the first emperor to have both a father and grandfather (who had adopted his father) as the two preceding emperors. commodus was the first (and until 337, the only) emperor "born in the purple", i.e., during his father's reign. commodus was assassinated in 192, succeeded by pertinax whose reign did not last long during the tumultuous year of the five emperors.
