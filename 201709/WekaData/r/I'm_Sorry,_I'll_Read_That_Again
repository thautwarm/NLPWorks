i'm sorry, i'll read that again (often abbreviated as isirta) is a bbc radio comedy programme that originated from the cambridge university footlights revue cambridge circus. it had a devoted youth following, with live recordings being more akin to a rock concert than a comedy show, a tradition that continued to i'm sorry i haven't a clue. the pilot programme and series 1 were broadcast on the bbc home service. series 2â€“9 were broadcast on the bbc light programme (renamed bbc radio 2 in september 1967). it was first broadcast on 3 april 1964, the pilot programme having been broadcast on 30 december 1963 under the title "cambridge circus". the ninth series was transmitted in november and december 1973. an hour-long 25th anniversary show was broadcast in 1989. it is comically introduced as "full frontal radio". i'm sorry i haven't a clue, a spinoff panel game show, was first produced in 1972. the title of the show comes from a sentence commonly used by bbc newsreaders following an on-air flub: "i'm sorry, i'll read that again." having the phrase used to recover from a mistake as the title of the show set the tone for the series as an irreverent and loosely produced comedy show.
