the callahan tunnel, officially the lieutenant william f. callahan jr. tunnel is one of four tunnels, and one of three road tunnels, beneath boston harbor in boston, massachusetts. it carries motor vehicles from the north end to logan international airport and route 1a in east boston. ordinarily, this tunnel is only used to carry traffic out of the city, and with the completion of the big dig it only collects traffic from i-93 southbound (right after traffic merges from storrow drive) and downtown boston. there is no toll in this direction, though booth-less tolls are under construction in both directions. traffic from the airport and route 1a towards downtown boston and i-93 northbound normally flows in the older, parallel sumner tunnel, where a $3.50 toll is collected (raised from $3 on january 1, 2008). repair work to this tunnel had resulted in a complete closure, which began at 11 pm on december 27, 2013 and ended on march 10, 2014, two days before the scheduled reopening. a second phase of work will take place between march 13, 2014 to late august 2014. the tunnel will be open and no work will be performed during the day, the tunnel will be closed overnight from 11 pm to 5 am. from august to mid-november 2014, finish work will be performed during off-peak hours.
