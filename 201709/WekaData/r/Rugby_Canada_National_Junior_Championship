the rugby canada national junior championship was an amateur rugby union competition in canada. it only lasted two seasons, 2009 and 2010. the 2009 champion was the vancouver wave, and the 2010 championship went to the newfoundland rock. the league was created when rugby canada decided to disband the rugby canada super league (rcsl) and replace it with a new under-20 league. the league consisted of 13 teams, and was broken up into 4 divisions; pacific, prairie, central, and atlantic. the league was intended to train, test, and get young rugby players ready so that someday they will be able to compete for the canadian national rugby union team.
