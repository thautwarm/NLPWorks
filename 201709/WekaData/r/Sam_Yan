sam yan (thai: สามย่าน  [sǎːm jâːn]) is the name of an intersection and its nearby neighbourhood in bangkok, thailand. it connects rama iv road (which runs in an east-west direction) with phaya thai road to the north and si phraya road to the south, and is located within pathum wan district, next to its border with bang rak. originally consisting only of an at-grade intersection, the thai–japan flyover bridge, constructed in 1992, now allows rama iv traffic to bypass sam yan, as well as the eastward henri dunant and sala daeng intersections. the intersection area is served by the sam yan station of the mrt, which connects to the chamchuri square complex and wat hua lamphong in the intersections' northeastern and southeastern corners, respectively. the large campus of chulalongkorn university lies alongside phaya thai road to the north of the intersection. the neighbourhood known as sam yan lies in the northwest corner of the intersection, and consisted until recently of various shophouses which held many well-known restaurants. at the heart of the neighbourhood was sam yan market, a permanent foodstuff marketplace established in 1965, whose cheap upstairs restaurants were popular with young people, particularly students from the nearby technical colleges. in 2008 chulalongkorn university, which owns the area's real estate, began work on development plans which required the demolition of old establishments at the immediate intersection. sam yan market was relocated a few hundred meters away and most shop owners followed, shifting the area's center of gravity slightly to the northwest nearer suphachalasai stadium.
