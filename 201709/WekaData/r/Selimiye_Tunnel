the selimiye tunnel (turkish: selimiye tüneli) is a road tunnel constructed on the black sea coastal highway d-010 e70 between hopa and kemalpaşa in artvin province, northeastern turkey. situated near selimiye village, the 1,366 m (4,482 ft)-long single-tube tunnel carries two lanes of traffic in east-bound direction only. selimiye tunnel is flanked by a series of shorter tunnels on the same route. the construction of the tunnel was preceded by a major landslide, which occurs often in the region. after the east-bound part of divided highway was blocked by a landslide, traffic was maintained a long time on the west-bound part. the problem was solved by building of a series of tunnels built on the east-bound highway part in the vicinity of selimiye village. the construction works began on august 25, 2009. in october 2010, the tunnel was put into service. another landslide, which took place at the same place in october 2013, blocked this time the west-bound part of the highway in a length of 150 m (490 ft). during the road maintenance period, selimiye tunnel was used bi-directional.
