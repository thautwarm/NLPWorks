clifton's cafeteria, once part of a chain of eight clifton's restaurants, is the oldest surviving cafeteria style eatery in los angeles. and the largest public cafeteria in the world. founded in 1931 by clifford clinton, the name was created by combining "clifford" and "clinton" to produce "clifton's". the design of the restaurants included exotic decor and facades that were "kitschy and theatrical". the second clifton's facility opened in 1935 at 648 s broadway. in 1939 its name was changed to 'clifton's brookdale', and as the sole survivor of the multiple branches over 79 years, it is now known as 'clifton's cafeteria' or simply as "clifton's". it has remained in operation for 74 years. the restaurant chain was noted for each facility having its own theme, and for aiding those who could not afford to pay. this approach to business reflected the owner's christian ethosâ€”he never turned anyone away hungry and maintained a precedent set by the first restaurant on olive street, known as "clifton's golden rule". in 1946, clifford and his wife nelda sold their cafeteria interests to their three younger clinton children, and retired to devote their attentions to a meals for millions, a non-profit charitable organization he founded in the wake of world war ii to distribute food to millions of starving and malnourished people throughout the world. clifton's brookdale was sold to nightclub operator andrew meieran on september 21, 2010. meieran intended renovations to preserve its unique atmosphere, as well the restaurant's 1950-style recipes. in february 2012 meieran said the remodeling was expected to continue for another 18 months. clifton's brookdale reopened october 1, 2015.
