the crow, called the aps√°alooke in their own siouan language, or variants including absaroka, are native americans, who in historical times lived in the yellowstone river valley, which extends from present-day wyoming, through montana and into north dakota, where it joins the missouri river. today, they are enrolled in the federally recognized crow tribe of montana. pressured by the ojibwe and cree peoples (the iron confederacy), who had earlier and better access to guns through the fur trade, they had migrated there from the ohio eastern woodland area to settle south of lake winnipeg, canada. from there, they were pushed to the west by the cheyennes. both the crow and the cheyennes were then pushed farther west by the lakota (sioux), who took over the territory from the black hills of south dakota to the big horn mountains of montana; the cheyennes finally became close allies of the sioux, but the crows remained bitter enemies of both sioux and cheyennes. the crow were generally friendly with the whites and managed to retain a large reservation of over 9300 km2 despite territorial losses. since the 19th century, crow people have been concentrated on their reservation established south of billings, montana. they also live in several major, mainly western, cities. tribal headquarters are located at crow agency, montana.
