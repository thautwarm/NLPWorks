abu salim prison (arabic: سجن أبو سليم) is a maximum security prison in tripoli, libya. the prison was notorious during the rule of muammar gaddafi for alleged mistreatment and human rights abuses, including a massacre in 1996 in which human rights watch estimated that 1,270 prisoners were killed. in 2011, when the ntc invited investigators from cnn and other organizations it found only what appeared to be animal bones at that site and announced further investigations.
