a terrestrial planet, telluric planet, or rocky planet is a planet that is composed primarily of silicate rocks or metals. within the solar system, the terrestrial planets are the inner planets closest to the sun, i.e. mercury, venus, earth, and mars. the terms "terrestrial planet" and "telluric planet" are derived from latin words for earth (terra and tellus), as these planets are, in terms of composition, "earth-like". terrestrial planets have a solid planetary surface, making them substantially different from the larger giant planets, which are composed mostly of some combination of hydrogen, helium, and water existing in various physical states.
