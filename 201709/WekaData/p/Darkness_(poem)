darkness is a poem written by lord byron in july 1816. that year was known as the year without a summer, because mount tambora had erupted in the dutch east indies the previous year, casting enough sulphur into the atmosphere to reduce global temperatures and cause abnormal weather across much of north-east america and northern europe. this pall of darkness inspired byron to write his poem. literary critics were initially content to classify it as a "last man" poem, telling the apocalyptic story of the last man on earth. more recent critics have focused on the poem's historical context, as well as the anti-biblical nature of the poem, despite its many references to the bible. the poem was written only months after the end of byron's marriage to anne isabella milbanke.
