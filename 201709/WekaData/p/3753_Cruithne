3753 cruithne (/kruːˈiːnjə/ or /ˈkrʊnjə/) is a q-type, aten asteroid in orbit around the sun in 1:1 orbital resonance with earth, making it a co-orbital object. it is an asteroid that, relative to earth, orbits in a bean-shaped orbit that effectively describes a horseshoe, and that can transition into a quasi-satellite orbit. it has been incorrectly called "earth's second moon". cruithne does not orbit earth and at times it is on the other side of the sun. its orbit takes it inside the orbit of mercury and outside the orbit of mars. cruithne orbits the sun in about 1 year but it takes 770 years for the series to complete a horseshoe-shaped movement around the earth. the name cruithne is from old irish and refers to the early picts (irish: cruthin) in the annals of ulster and their eponymous king ("cruidne, son of cinge") in the pictish chronicle.
