lua (/ˈluːə/ loo-ə, from portuguese: lua [ˈlu.(w)ɐ] meaning moon) is a lightweight multi-paradigm programming language designed primarily for embedded systems and clients. lua is cross-platform since it is written in ansi c, and has a relatively simple c api. lua was originally designed in 1993 as a language for extending software applications to meet the increasing demand for customization at the time. it provided the basic facilities of most procedural programming languages, but more complicated or domain-specific features were not included; rather, it included mechanisms for extending the language, allowing programmers to implement such features. as lua was intended to be a general embeddable extension language, the designers of lua focused on improving its speed, portability, extensibility, and ease-of-use in development.
