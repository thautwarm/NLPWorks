nema connectors are power plugs and receptacles used for ac mains electricity in north america and other countries that use the standards set by the us national electrical manufacturers association. nema wiring devices are made in current ratings from 15 to 60 amperes (a), with voltage ratings from 125 to 600 volts (v). different combinations of contact blade widths, shapes, orientation, and dimensions create non-interchangeable connectors that are unique for each combination of voltage, electric current carrying capacity, and grounding system. nema 1 (two-prong, no safety ground) and nema 5 (three-prong, with safety ground pin) connectors are used for commonplace domestic electrical equipment; the others are for heavy duty or special purposes such as use in data centers. nema 5-15r is the standard 15 a capacity electric receptacle (outlet) found in the united states. similar and interchangeable connectors are used in canada and mexico. the dimensional standard for electrical connectors is ansi/nema wd-6 and is available from the nema website.
