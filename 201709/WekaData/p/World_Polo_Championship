the world polo championship is a polo competition between countries. the event is organised by the sport's governing body, the federation of international polo (fip), and is contested by the national teams. there is no restriction on the gender of the players. the inaugural tournament was held in 1987, hosted by argentina, and is now contested every three or four years. the participating teams must have a handicap up to 14 goals. it's for this reason that, unlike other sports, the best players can't play the world polo championship. the next championship will be hosted in sydney in 2017 at the sydney polo club. team information is not yet available.
