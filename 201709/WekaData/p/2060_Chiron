2060 chiron, also known as 95p/chiron, is a minor planet in the outer solar system, orbiting the sun between saturn and uranus. discovered in 1977 by charles t. kowal (precovery images have been found as far back as 1895), it was the first-identified member of a new class of objects now known as centaursâ€”bodies orbiting between the asteroid belt and the kuiper belt. besides the four giant planets, chiron and 10199 chariklo, also a centaur, are the only other bodies in the solar system known to have rings. although it was initially called an asteroid and classified only as a minor planet with the designation "2060 chiron", it was later found to exhibit behavior typical of a comet. today it is classified as both a minor planet and a comet, and is accordingly also known by the cometary designation "95p/chiron". chiron is named after the centaur chiron in greek mythology. michael brown lists it as possibly a dwarf planet with a measured diameter of 206 km (128 miles) which is near the lower limit for an icy dwarf planet (around 200 km, or 124 miles).
