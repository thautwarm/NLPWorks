multiple patterning (or multi-patterning) is a class of technologies for manufacturing integrated circuits (ics), developed for photolithography to enhance the feature density. it is expected to be necessary for the upcoming 10 nm and 7 nm node semiconductor processes and beyond. the premise is that a single lithographic exposure may not be enough to provide sufficient resolution. hence additional exposures would be needed, or else positioning patterns using etched feature sidewalls (using spacers) would be necessary. although euv has been projected to be the next-generation lithography of choice, it would still require more than one lithographic exposure, due to the foreseen need to first print a series of lines and then cut them. it is also likely more than one cut would be needed, even for euv. even for electron beam lithography, single exposure appears insufficient at ~10 nm half-pitch, hence requiring double patterning.
