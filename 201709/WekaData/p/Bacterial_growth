bacterial growth is the asexual reproduction, or cell division, of a bacterium into two daughter cells, in a process called binary fission. providing no mutational event occurs the resulting daughter cells are genetically identical to the original cell. hence, "local doubling" of the bacterial population occurs. both daughter cells from the division do not necessarily survive. however, if the number surviving exceeds unity on average, the bacterial population undergoes exponential growth. the measurement of an exponential bacterial growth curve in batch culture was traditionally a part of the training of all microbiologists; the basic means requires bacterial enumeration (cell counting) by direct and individual (microscopic, flow cytometry), direct and bulk (biomass), indirect and individual (colony counting), or indirect and bulk (most probable number, turbidity, nutrient uptake) methods. models reconcile theory with the measurements.
