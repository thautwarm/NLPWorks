botulinum toxin (btx) is a neurotoxic protein produced by the bacterium clostridium botulinum and related species. botulinum toxin causes the disease botulism, however it is also used commercially in medicine, cosmetics, and research. there are seven types of botulinum toxin, named type a–g. type a and b are capable of causing disease in humans, and are also used commercially and medically. types c–g are less common; types e and f can cause disease in humans, while the other types cause disease in other animals. botulinum toxin types a and b are used in medicine to treat various muscle spasms and diseases characterized by overactive muscle.the u.s. food and drug administration requires a boxed warning stating that when locally administered the toxin may spread from the injection site to other areas of the body, causing botulism. the warning was the result of deaths associated with its uses. infection with the bacterium may result in a potentially fatal disease called botulism. botulinum is the most acutely lethal toxin known, with an estimated human median lethal dose (ld50) of 1.3–2.1 ng/kg intravenously or intramuscularly and 10–13 ng/kg when inhaled. the commercial form is marketed under the brand name botox, among others. botox is made by allergan.
