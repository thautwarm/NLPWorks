(this article is about the modern system that opened in 2016. for this historic system, see streetcars in cincinnati. for the never-built system, see metromoves.) the cincinnati bell connector, previously known as the cincinnati streetcar, is a streetcar system in cincinnati, ohio, united states. the system opened to passengers on september 9, 2016. the streetcar operates on a 3.6-mile (5.8 km) loop from the banks, great american ball park, and smale riverfront park through downtown cincinnati and north to findlay market in the northern edge of the over-the-rhine neighborhood. future extensions have been proposed to the uptown area, home to the university of cincinnati, the regional hospitals, and the cincinnati zoo; and to northern kentucky. the project faced opposition on several occasions after being first proposed in 2007. challenges included ballot initiatives to stop the project in 2009 and 2011, opposition from members of cincinnati city council, governor john kasich, and mayor john cranley (elected in 2013). however, both of the anti-rail ballot initiatives were rejected by voters, and a pro-streetcar majority was elected to city council in 2011, allowing the project to move forward. naming rights to the system were purchased by cincinnati bell in a $3.4 million, 10-year deal in august 2016.
