calamondin (× citrofortunella microcarpa or × citrofortunella mitis) is an important citrofortunella, meaning that it is an intergenetic hybrid between a member of the genus citrus (in this case probably the mandarin orange) and the kumquat belonging to fortunella. calamondin is used mainly as an ornamental tree, rather than for food, although the fruit is edible.
