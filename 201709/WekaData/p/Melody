a melody (from greek μελῳδία, melōidía, "singing, chanting"), also tune, voice, or line, is a linear succession of musical tones that the listener perceives as a single entity. in its most literal sense, a melody is a combination of pitch and rhythm, while more figuratively, the term can include successions of other musical elements such as tonal color. it may be considered the foreground to the background accompaniment. a line or part need not be a foreground melody. melodies often consist of one or more musical phrases or motifs, and are usually repeated throughout a composition in various forms. melodies may also be described by their melodic motion or the pitches or the intervals between pitches (predominantly conjunct or disjunct or with further restrictions), pitch range, tension and release, continuity and coherence, cadence, and shape. the true goal of music—its proper enterprise—is melody. all the parts of harmony have as their ultimate purpose only beautiful melody. therefore, the question of which is the more significant, melody or harmony, is futile. beyond doubt, the means is subordinate to the end.— johann philipp kirnberger (1771)
