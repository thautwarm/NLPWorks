1703 barry, provisional designation 1930 rb, is a 10-kilometer sized stony asteroid and suspected tumbler from the inner regions of the asteroid belt. it was discovered by german astronomer max wolf at heidelberg observatory on 2 september 1930. in the same month, it was independently discovered by dutch astronomer hendrik van gent and soviet astronomer evgenii skvortsov at their observatories in johannesburg and crimea, respectively. the relatively bright s-type asteroid with an albedo of about 0.28 is a member of the flora family, a large group that accounts for up to 5% of all main-belt asteroids. it orbits the sun at a distance of 1.8–2.6 au once every 3.30 years (1,204 days). its orbit shows an eccentricity of 0.17 and is tilted by 5 degrees to the plane of the ecliptic. photometric observations reported in 2007 showed a leisurely rotation period of 107.1±0.5 hours with a brightness variation of 0.5 magnitude. it may have a non-principal axis rotation. however, no follow-up measurements have since confirmed its tumbling motion. the asteroid is named after vincentian priest roger barry (1752–1813), the court astronomer of grand duchy of baden at the mannheim observatory in 1788. the heidelberg observatory is a direct successor to the old mannheim observatory.
