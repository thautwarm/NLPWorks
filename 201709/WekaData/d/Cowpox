cowpox is an infectious disease caused by the cowpox virus. the virus, part of the orthopoxvirus family, is closely related to the vaccinia virus. the virus is zoonotic, meaning that it is transferable between species, such as from animal to human. the transferral of the disease was first observed in dairymaids who touched the udders of infected cows and consequently developed the signature pustules on their hands. cowpox is more commonly found in animals other than bovines, such as rodents. cowpox is similar to, but much milder than, the highly contagious and often deadly smallpox disease. its close resemblance to the mild form of smallpox and the observation that dairymaids were immune from smallpox inspired the first smallpox vaccine, created and administered by english physician edward jenner. the word “vaccination,” coined by jenner in 1796, is derived from the latin root vaccinus, meaning of or from the cow. once vaccinated, a patient develops antibodies that make him/her immune to cowpox, but they also develop immunity to the smallpox virus, or variola virus. the cowpox vaccinations and later incarnations proved so successful that in 1980, the world health organization announced that smallpox was the first disease to be eradicated by vaccination efforts worldwide. other orthopox viruses remain prevalent in certain communities and continue to infect humans, such as the cowpox virus (cpxv) in europe, vaccinia in brazil, and monkeypox virus in central and west africa.
