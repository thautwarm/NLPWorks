nottely dam is a hydroelectric and flood storage dam on the nottely river in union county, in the u.s. state of georgia. the dam is owned and operated by the tennessee valley authority, which built the dam in the early 1940s as a flood control structure and to help regulate flow at nearby hiwassee dam. the dam impounds the lake nottely of 4,180 acres (16.9 km2). while the dam was built primarily for flood storage, a generator was installed at nottely in the 1950s, giving it a small hydroelectric output. nottely dam was named for the nottely river. the river itself was named after the cherokee village of naduhli, which was once situated along its banks. the village name is derived from native american word for "daring horseman."
