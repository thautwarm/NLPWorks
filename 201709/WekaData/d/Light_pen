a light pen is a computer input device in the form of a light-sensitive wand used in conjunction with a computer's crt display. it allows the user to point to displayed objects or draw on the screen in a similar way to a touchscreen but with greater positional accuracy. a light pen can work with any crt-based display and other display technologies, but its ability to be used with lcds was unclear (though toshiba and hitachi displayed a similar idea at the "display 2006" show in japan). a light pen detects a change of brightness of nearby screen pixels when scanned by cathode ray tube electron beam and communicates the timing of this event to the computer. since a crt scans the entire screen one pixel at a time, the computer can keep track of the expected time of scanning various locations on screen by the beam and infer the pen's position from the latest timestamp.
