in bioinformatics, mirbase is a biological database that acts as an archive of microrna sequences and annotations. as of september 2010 it contained information about 15,172 micrornas. the mirbase registry provides a centralised system for assigning new names to microrna genes. mirbase grew from the microrna registry resource set up by sam griffiths-jones in 2003. according to kozomara and griffiths-jones mirbase has five aims: 1.  
*  to provide a consistent naming system for micrornas 2.  
*  to provide a central place collecting all known microrna sequences 3.  
*  to provide human and computer readable information for each microrna 4.  
*  to provide primary evidence for each microrna 5.  
*  to aggregate and link to microrna target information
