in molecular biology, disprot is a curated biological database collection of intrinsically unstructured proteins. historically, the study of disordered proteins has been hampered by the lack of an organised resource collecting them and their properties together. release 6.01 of disprot contains information on 684 proteins. each protein entry in disprot is characterised by a disprot identifier which takes the form of the prefix dp followed by a 5 digit protein identifier. for example, dp000016 refers to the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1 protein. disprot has been widely used to train software methods to predict disordered regions in proteins. in addition, disprot has been used to understand the properties of intrinsically unstructured proteins.
