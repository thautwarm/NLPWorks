the biological general repository for interaction datasets (biogrid) is a curated biological database of protein-protein interactions, genetic interactions, chemical interactions, and post-translational modifications created in 2003 (originally referred to as simply the general repository for interaction datasets (grid) by mike tyers, bobby-joe breitkreutz, and chris stark at the lunenfeld-tanenbaum research institute at mount sinai hospital. it strives to provide a comprehensive curated resource for all major model organism species while attempting to remove redundancy to create a single mapping of data. users of the biogrid can search for their protein or publication of interest and retrieve annotation, as well as curated data as reported, by the primary literature and compiled by in house large-scale curation efforts. the biogrid is hosted in toronto, ontario, canada and dallas, texas, united states and is partnered with the saccharomyces genome database. the biogrid is funded by the bbsrc, nih, and cihr. biogrid is a member of the international molecular exchange consortium (imex).
