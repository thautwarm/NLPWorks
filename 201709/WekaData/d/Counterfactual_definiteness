in quantum mechanics, counterfactual definiteness (cfd) is the ability to speak meaningfully of the definiteness of the results of measurements that have not been performed (i.e. the ability to assume the existence of objects, and properties of objects, even when they have not been measured). the term "counterfactual definiteness" is used in discussions of physics calculations, especially those related to the phenomenon called quantum entanglement and those related to the bell inequalities. the single adjective "counterfactual" may also appear in physics discussions where it is frequently treated as a noun. the word "counterfactual" does not mean "characterized by being opposed to fact." instead, it is used to characterize values that could have been measured but, for one reason or another, were not.
