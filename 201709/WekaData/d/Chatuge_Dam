chatuge dam is a flood control and hydroelectric dam on the hiwassee river in clay county, in the u.s. state of north carolina. the dam is the uppermost of three dams on the river owned and operated by the tennessee valley authority, which built the dam in the early 1940s for flood storage and to provide flow regulation at hiwassee dam further downstream. the dam impounds the 7,000-acre (2,800 ha) chatuge lake, which straddles the north carolina-georgia state line. while originally built solely for flood storage, a generator installed at chatuge in the 1950s gives the dam a small hydroelectric output. chatuge dam is named for an 18th-century cherokee village once situated near the dam site.
