apraxia is a motor disorder caused by damage to the brain (specifically the posterior parietal cortex), in which the individual has difficulty with the motor planning to perform tasks or movements when asked, provided that the request or command is understood and he/she is willing to perform the task. a person with apraxia cannot move his or her lips or tongue to the right place to say sounds correctly because, even though the muscles are not weak, the messages from the brain to the mouth are disrupted. the nature of the brain damage determines the severity.
