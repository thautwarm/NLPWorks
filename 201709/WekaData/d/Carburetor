a carburetor (american and canadian spelling), carburator, carburettor, or carburetter (commonwealth spelling) is a device that blends air and fuel for an internal combustion engine. it is sometimes colloquially shortened to carb in north america or carby in australia. to carburate or carburet (and thus carburation or carburetion, respectively) is to blend the air and fuel or to equip (an engine) with a carburetor for that purpose. carburetors have largely been supplanted in the automotive and, to a lesser extent, aviation industries by fuel injection. they are still common on small engines for lawn mowers, rototillers, and other equipment.
