hyoscine hydrobromide, also known as scopolamine hydrobromide, is a medication used in the treatment of motion sickness and postoperative nausea and vomiting. one common side effect is drowsiness. scopolamine is a tropane alkaloid drug that acts as a competitive antagonist at muscarinic acetylcholine receptors; it is thus classified as an anticholinergic, antimuscarinic drug. although it is usually referred to as a nonspecific antagonist, there is indirect evidence for m1-receptor subtype specificity. it is on the world health organization's list of essential medicines, the most important medications needed in a basic health system. scopolamine is named after the plant genus scopolia. the name "hyoscine" is from the scientific name for henbane, hyoscyamus niger.
