the meredith effect is a phenomenon whereby the aerodynamic drag produced by a cooling radiator may be offset by careful design of the cooling duct such that useful thrust is produced. the effect was discovered in the 1930s and became more important as the speeds of piston-engined aircraft increased over the next decade.
