a duplexer is an electronic device that allows bi-directional (duplex) communication over a single path. in radar and radio communications systems, it isolates the receiver from the transmitter while permitting them to share a common antenna. most radio repeater systems include a duplexer. duplexers can be based on frequency (often a waveguide filter), polarization (such as an orthomode transducer), or timing (as is typical in radar).
