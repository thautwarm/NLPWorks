mescaline, or 3,4,5-trimethoxyphenethylamine, is a naturally occurring psychedelic alkaloid of the phenethylamine class, known for its hallucinogenic effects comparable to those of lsd and psilocybin. it occurs naturally in the peyote cactus (lophophora williamsii), the san pedro cactus (echinopsis pachanoi), the peruvian torch (echinopsis peruviana), and in a number of other members of the cactaceae plant family. it is also found in small amounts in certain members of the fabaceae (bean) family, including acacia berlandieri.
