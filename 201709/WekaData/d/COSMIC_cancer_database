the cosmic database was designed to collect and display information on somatic mutations in cancer. it was launched in 2004, with data from just four genes, hras, kras2, nras and braf. these four genes are known to be somatically mutated in cancer. since its creation, the database has expanded rapidly. by 2005 cosmic contained 529 genes screened from 115,327 tumours, describing 20,981 mutations. by august 2009 it contained information from 1.5 million experiments performed, encompassing 13,423 genes in almost 370,000 tumours and describing over 90,000 mutations. cosmic version 48, released in july 2010, incorporates mutation data from p53 in collaboration with the international agency for research on cancer. in addition, it provided updated gene co-ordinates for the most recent human reference genome builds. this release includes data from over 2.76 million experiments on over half a million tumours. the number of mutations documented in this release totals 141,212. the website is focused on presenting complex phenotype-specific mutation data in a graphical manner. data is taken from selected genes, initially in the cancer gene census, as well as literature search from pubmed.
