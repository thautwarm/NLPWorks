in mathematics, a conformal map is a function that preserves angles locally. in the most common case, the function has a domain and an image in the complex plane. more formally, a map f : u → v with u, v ⊆ ℂn is called conformal (or angle-preserving) at a point u0 if it preserves oriented angles between curves through u0 with respect to their orientation (i.e. not just the magnitude of the angle). conformal maps preserve both angles and the shapes of infinitesimally small figures, but not necessarily their size or curvature. the conformal property may be described in terms of the jacobian derivative matrix of a coordinate transformation. if the jacobian matrix of the transformation is everywhere a scalar times a rotation matrix, then the transformation is conformal. conformal maps can be defined between domains in higher-dimensional euclidean spaces, and more generally on a riemannian or semi-riemannian manifold.
