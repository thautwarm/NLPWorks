hiwassee dam is a hydroelectric dam on the hiwassee river in cherokee county, in the u.s. state of north carolina. it is one of three dams on the river owned and operated by the tennessee valley authority, which built the dam in the late 1930s to bring flood control and electricity to the region. the dam impounds the hiwassee lake of 6,000 acres (2,400 ha), and its tailwaters are part of apalachia lake. at 307 feet (94 m), hiwassee dam is the third highest dam in the tva system, behind only fontana and watauga. hiwassee dam is named after the hiwassee river. the river's name is derived from the cherokee word for savanna, or large meadow, and had been applied to two of the tribe's villages along the river in the 18th century.
