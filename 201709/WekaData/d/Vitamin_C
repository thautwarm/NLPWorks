vitamin c or l-ascorbic acid, or simply ascorbate (the anion of ascorbic acid), is an essential nutrient for humans and certain other animal species. vitamin c describes several vitamers that have vitamin c activity in animals, including ascorbic acid and its salts, and some oxidized forms of the molecule like dehydroascorbic acid. ascorbate and ascorbic acid are both naturally present in the body when either of these is introduced into cells, since the forms interconvert according to ph. vitamin c is a cofactor in at least eight enzymatic reactions, including several collagen synthesis reactions that, when dysfunctional, cause the most severe symptoms of scurvy. in animals, these reactions are especially important in wound-healing and in preventing bleeding from capillaries. ascorbate also acts as an antioxidant, protecting against oxidative stress. ascorbate is required for a range of essential metabolic reactions in all animals and plants. it is made internally by almost all organisms; the main exceptions are most bats, all guinea pigs, capybaras, and the haplorrhini (one of the two major primate suborders, consisting of tarsiers, monkeys, and humans and other apes). ascorbate is also not synthesized by many species of birds and fish. all species that do not synthesize ascorbate require it in the diet. deficiency in this vitamin causes the disease scurvy in humans. ascorbic acid is also widely used as a food additive, to prevent oxidation.
