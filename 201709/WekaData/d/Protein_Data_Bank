the protein data bank (pdb) is a crystallographic database for the three-dimensional structural data of large biological molecules, such as proteins and nucleic acids. the data, typically obtained by x-ray crystallography, nmr spectroscopy, or, increasingly, cryo-electron microscopy, and submitted by biologists and biochemists from around the world, are freely accessible on the internet via the websites of its member organisations (pdbe, pdbj, and rcsb). the pdb is overseen by an organization called the worldwide protein data bank, wwpdb. the pdb is a key resource in areas of structural biology, such as structural genomics. most major scientific journals, and some funding agencies, now require scientists to submit their structure data to the pdb. many other databases use protein structures deposited in the pdb. for example, scop and cath classify protein structures, while pdbsum provides a graphic overview of pdb entries using information from other sources, such as gene ontology
