the douglas gam-87 skybolt (agm-48 under the 1962 tri-service system) was an air-launched ballistic missile (albm), equipped with a thermonuclear warhead, developed by the united states during the late 1950s. the uk joined the program in 1960, intending to use it on their v bomber force. a series of test failures and the development of submarine-launched ballistic missiles (slbms) eventually led to its cancellation in december 1962. the uk had decided to base its entire 1960s deterrent force on skybolt, and its cancellation led to a major disagreement between the uk and us, known today as the "skybolt crisis". this was resolved during a series of meetings that led to the royal navy gaining the ugm-27 polaris missile and construction of the resolution-class submarines to launch them.
