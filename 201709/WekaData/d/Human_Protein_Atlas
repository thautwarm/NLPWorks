the human protein atlas (hpa) program is a scientific research program with the goal to explore the whole human proteome using an antibody-based approach. the program was started at the royal institute of technology, sweden, in 2003 and funded by the non-profit organization knut and alice wallenberg foundation (kaw). the project has a gene-centric approach with the effort to map and characterize a representative protein for each protein-coding human gene (approximately 20,000 genes). antibodies, both in-house produced and external (commercial and from collaborators), are validated in the hpa workflow and used for protein characterization. the data is released annually in a publicly available information database portal. the database includes protein expression profiles from 44 different normal and 20 different cancer tissues, 46 cell lines, subcellular localization and transcript expression levels. the database is searchable for a specific gene or protein. functionalities added to the the human protein atlas in later versions allow for combined searches, e.g. to find all proteins expressed in a certain organ or tissue or proteins differentially expressed in a specific tumor type.
