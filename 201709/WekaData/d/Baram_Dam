the baram dam, also known as baram 1 dam, (baram hydro-electric dam project) is a proposed gravity dam on the baram river in the malaysian state of sarawak on the island of borneo. the site of the dam is 250 kilometres (160 mi) inland from miri, the second largest city in sarawak. the dam is part of the sarawak corridor of renewable energy and, if completed, would support a 1,200 mw power station. in november 2015, the sarawak chief minister tan sri adenan satem announced that the sarawak government had decided to shelf the baram dam because the people in baram did not welcome the plan.
