metabolite set enrichment analysis (msea) is a method designed to help metabolomics researchers identify and interpret patterns of metabolite concentration changes in a biologically meaningful way. it is conceptually similar to another widely used tool developed for transcriptomics called gene set enrichment analysis or gsea. gsea uses a collection of predefined gene sets to rank the lists of genes obtained from gene chip studies. by using this “prior knowledge” about gene sets researchers are able to readily identify significant and coordinated changes in gene expression data while at the same time gaining some biological context. msea does the same thing by using a collection of predefined metabolite pathways and disease states obtained from the human metabolome database. msea is offered as a service both through a stand-alone web server  and as part of a larger metabolomics analysis suite called metaboanalyst.
