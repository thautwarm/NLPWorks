the heavy expanded mobility tactical truck (hemtt) is an eight-wheel drive, diesel-powered, tactical truck used by the us military and others. in evolving configurations it has been in continuous production since 1982. the m977 hemtt entered service with the u.s. army as a replacement for the m520 goer. by early 2015 more than 27,000 hemtts in various configurations had been produced by oshkosh defense through either new-build or re-manufactured. current variants have the a4 suffix. the 10x10 oshkosh logistic vehicle system replacement (lvsr) is the u.s. marines’ equivalent of the u.s. army’s oshkosh 8x8 hemtt and oshkosh 10x10 palletized load system (pls). the marines do not use the hemtt or pls, and the army does not use the lvsr, but both services use a common trailer (m1076) with all three truck types.
