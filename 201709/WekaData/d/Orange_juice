orange juice is the liquid extract of the fruit of the orange tree, extracted by squeezing oranges. it comes in several different varieties, including blood orange. in american english, the beverage name may be abbreviated as "oj". due to the importance of oranges to the economy of the state of florida, "the juice obtained from mature oranges of the species citrus sinensis and hybrids thereof" was adopted as the official beverage of florida in 1967. orange juice (along with grapefruit juice) is offered to every visitor at each of the state's five florida welcome centers. commercial orange juice with a long shelf life is made by drying and later rehydrating the juice, or by concentrating the juice and later adding water to the concentrate. prior to drying, the juice may also be pasteurized and oxygen removed from it, necessitating the later addition of a flavor pack, generally made from orange products. the health value of orange juice is debatable. it has a high concentration of vitamin c, but also a very high concentration of simple sugars, comparable to soft drinks such as colas. as a result, some government nutritional advice has been adjusted to encourage substitution of orange juice with raw fruit, which is digested more slowly, and limit daily consumption.
