"you used this rope; you'll hang on a rope. and the whole camp will watch as you twist in the wind." the inmate's hands were tied behind his back and he was lifted two feet off the ground from a tree. the weight of his body was all on the shoulder joints and the pain was "excruciating beyond all description." strippel's next assignment from march – october 1941 was the natzweiler-struthof concentration camp in occupied france. strippel then served in majdanek near lublin poland, ravensbrück, then at peenemünde on the usedom peninsula, in the karlshagen ii forced labor camp, the site of v-2 rocket production and launches. from there the 's-hertogenbosch concentration camp in vught, the netherlands, more commonly known as camp vught. his final assignment was at neuengamme, where he oversaw the murders of the twenty jewish children involved in kurt heissmeyer's experiments, their four adult caretakers and twenty-four soviet p.o.w.'s. they were all hung in the basement of the bullenhuser damm school, the adults from overhead pipes and the children from a hook on the wall.
