the avignon papacy was the period from 1309 to 1377 during which seven successive popes resided in avignon (then in the kingdom of arles, part of the holy roman empire, now in today's france) rather than in rome. the situation arose from the conflict between the papacy and the french crown. following the strife between philip iv of france and pope boniface viii and the death of his successor benedict xi after only eight months in office, a deadlocked conclave finally elected clement v, a frenchman, as pope in 1305. clement declined to move to rome, remaining in france, and in 1309, he moved his court to the papal enclave at avignon, where it remained for the next 67 years. the absence from rome is sometimes referred to as the "babylonian captivity of the papacy". a total of seven popes reigned at avignon; all were french, and they increasingly fell under the influence of the french crown. finally, on september 13, 1376, gregory xi abandoned avignon and moved his court to rome (arriving on january 17, 1377), officially ending the avignon papacy. despite this return, following gregory's death on march 27, 1378, the breakdown in relations between the cardinals and gregory's successor, urban vi, gave rise to the western schism. this started a second line of avignon popes, now regarded as illegitimate and known as antipopes. the second and final avignon antipope, benedict xiii, lost most of his support in 1398, including that of france; following five years of siege by the french, he fled to perpignan on march 11, 1403. the schism ended in 1417 at the council of constance, after only two popes had reigned in opposition to the papacy in rome.
