7-dehydrocholesterol is a zoosterol that functions in the serum as a cholesterol precursor, and is converted to vitamin d3 in the skin, therefore functioning as provitamin-d3. the presence of this compound in human skin enables humans to manufacture vitamin d3 from ultraviolet rays in the sun light, via an intermediate isomer pre-vitamin d3. it is also found in the milk of several mammalian species. in insects it is a precursor for the hormone ecdysone, required for reaching adulthood. it was discovered by nobel-laureate organic chemist adolf windaus.
