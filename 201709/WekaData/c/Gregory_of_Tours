saint gregory of tours (30 november c. 538 â€“ 17 november 594) was a gallo-roman historian and bishop of tours, which made him a leading prelate of gaul. he was born georgius florentius, later adding the name gregorius in honour of his maternal great-grandfather. he is the main contemporary source for merovingian history. his most notable work was his decem libri historiarum or ten books of histories, better known as the historia francorum ("history of the franks"), a title given to it by later chroniclers, but he is also known for his accounts of the miracles of saints, especially four books of the miracles of martin of tours. st martin's tomb was a major draw in the 6th century, and gregory's writings had the practical aspect of promoting this highly organized devotion.
