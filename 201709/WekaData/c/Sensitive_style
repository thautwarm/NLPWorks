the sensitive style (german: empfindsamer stil), empfindsam style, or tender style is a style of musical composition and poetry developed in 18th-century germany, intended to express "true and natural" feelings, and featuring sudden contrasts of mood. it was developed as a contrast to the baroque affektenlehre (lit. "the doctrine of affections"), in which a composition (or movement) would have the same affect (e.g., emotion or musical mood) throughout.
