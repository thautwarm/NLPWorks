cycle collstrop (uci team code: cos) was a swedish uci professional continental cycling team. it was the successor to unibet.com, which was mainly sponsored by the online gambling website unibet.com and as a continuation of the mrbookmaker.com cycling team. the team rode on the european continental circuit, until the beginning of the 2007 season, when they were granted a protour licence. in 2008, they were awarded a professional continental licence. the new team was led by steffen wesemann, and problems previously experienced through having had sponsorship from a betting company were avoided with new sponsorship from a wooden flooring company. unibet.com had also been drawn into the operaci√≥n puerto doping investigation. the cyclist carlos quesada was named by the spanish authorities as a patient of dr. eufemiano fuentes and was suspended by the team. although quesada had been named, he has not yet been formally charged with doping, which led to the management of unibet.com to lift its suspension of quesada two weeks after it was imposed. nevertheless, the team did not pay the spanish cyclist his salary, which led to a lawsuit, finally resolved with quesada leaving the team in exchange for a compensation. the team, whose sponsors have pulled out of cycling, failed to submit its application for renewal by the 20 november 2007 deadline and did not take part in the 2008 uci protour. many of the team members went to the newly formed team vacansoleil.
