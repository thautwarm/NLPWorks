butanol (also called butyl alcohol) is a four-carbon alcohol with a formula of c4h9oh, which occurs in four isomeric structures, from a straight-chain primary alcohol to a branched-chain tertiary alcohol; all are a butyl or isobutyl group linked to a hydroxyl group (sometimes represented as buoh, n-buoh, and i-buoh). these are n-butanol, 2-butanol, tert-butanol, and isobutanol. butanol is primarily used as a solvent, as an intermediate in chemical synthesis, and as a fuel. it is sometimes also called biobutanol when produced biologically.
