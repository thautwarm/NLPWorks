the duchy of lorraine (french: lorraine, ipa: [lɔʁɛn]; german: lothringen), originally upper lorraine, was a duchy now included in the larger present-day region of lorraine in northeastern france. its capital was nancy. it was founded in 959 following the division of lotharingia into two separate duchies: upper and lower lorraine, the westernmost parts of the holy roman empire. the lower duchy was quickly dismantled, while upper lorraine came to be known as simply the duchy of lorraine. the duchy of lorraine was coveted and briefly occupied by the dukes of burgundy and the kings of france. in 1737, the duchy was given to stanisław leszczyński, the former king of poland, who had lost his throne as a result of the war of the polish succession, with the understanding that it would fall to the french crown on his death. when stanisław died on 23 february 1766, lorraine was annexed by france and reorganized as a province.
