the cape of good hope, also known as the cape colony (dutch: kaapkolonie), was a british colony in present-day south africa and namibia, named after the cape of good hope. the british colony was preceded by an earlier dutch colony of the same name, the kaap de goede hoop, established in 1652 by the dutch east india company. the dutch lost the colony to britain following the 1795 battle of muizenberg, but had it returned following the 1802 peace of amiens. it was re-occupied by the british following the battle of blaauwberg in 1806, and british possession affirmed with the anglo-dutch treaty of 1814. the cape of good hope then remained in the british empire, becoming self-governing in 1872, and uniting with three other colonies to form the union of south africa in 1910. it then was renamed the cape of good hope province. south africa became fully independent in 1931 by the statute of westminster. following the 1994 creation of the present-day south african provinces, the cape of good hope province was partitioned into the eastern cape, northern cape, and western cape, with smaller parts in north west province. the cape of good hope was coextensive with the later cape of good hope province, stretching from the atlantic coast inland and eastward along the southern coast, constituting about half of modern south africa: the final eastern boundary, after several wars against the xhosa, stood at the fish river. in the north, the orange river, also known as the gariep river, served as the boundary for some time, although some land between the river and the southern boundary of botswana was later added to it. from 1878, the colony also included the enclave of walvis bay and the penguin islands, both in what is now namibia.
