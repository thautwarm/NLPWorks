in optics, an index-matching material is a substance, usually a liquid, cement (adhesive), or gel, which has an index of refraction that closely approximates that of another object (such as a lens, material, fiber-optic, etc.). when two substances with the same index are next to each other, light passes from one to the other with neither reflection nor refraction. as such, they are used for various purposes in science, engineering, and art. for example, in a popular home experiment, a glass rod is made almost invisible by immersing it in an index-matched transparent fluid such as mineral spirits.
