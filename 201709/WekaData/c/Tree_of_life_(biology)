the tree of life or universal tree of life is a metaphor used to describe the relationships between organisms, both living and extinct, as described in a famous passage in charles darwin's on the origin of species (1859). tree-diagrams originated in the medieval era to represent genealogical relationships. phylogenetic tree diagrams in the evolutionary sense date back to at least the early 19th century. the term phylogeny for the evolutionary relationships of species through time was coined by ernst haeckel, who went further than darwin in proposing phylogenic histories of life. in contemporary usage, tree of life refers to the compilation of comprehensive phylogenetic database rooted at the last universal common ancestor of life on earth. the open tree of life, first published 2015, is a project to compile such a database for free public access.
