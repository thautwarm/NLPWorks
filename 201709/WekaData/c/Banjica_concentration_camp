the banjica concentration camp (german: anhalteleger dedinje) was a german concentration camp in the territory of the military commander in serbia during world war ii. located in the banjica neighborhood of dedinje—a suburb of belgrade—it was originally used by the germans as a center for holding hostages. the camp was later used to hold serbs, jews, roma, captured partisans, chetniks and other opponents of nazi germany. by 1942, most executions occurred at the firing ranges at jajinci, marinkova bara and the jewish cemetery. banjica was operational from july 1941 to october 1944. it was jointly run by german occupying forces under the command of gestapo official willy friedrich and the serbian state guard. the serbian administrator of the camp was svetozar vujković, a pre-war policeman who enthusiastically collaborated with the germans. later, both he and friedrich were tried, found guilty and executed for war crimes by yugoslavia's post-war communist authorities. 23,697 individuals were detained in banjica throughout the war, at least 3,849 of whom perished. after the war, a small monument dedicated to the victims of the camp was constructed. the museum of the banjica concentration camp was opened in 1969, and contains more than four hundred items relating to the camp and its operation.
