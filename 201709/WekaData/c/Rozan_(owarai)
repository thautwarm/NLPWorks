rozan (ロザン) is a japanese comedy (manzai) duo (kombi) from osaka consisting of hirofumi suga (菅 広文, 10/29/1976-) as boke and fuminori ujihara (宇治原 史規, 4/20/1976-) as tsukkomi under the entertainment agency, yoshimoto kogyo. formed in 1996, they are best known for their stand-up acts and tv tarento activities in variety and quiz shows. ujihara is known as one of the most competitive quiz show contestants. having attended highly ranked public universities, the two are broadly recognized as "highly educated comedians". however, suga eventually dropped out of osaka prefecture university while ujihara graduated from kyoto university spending 9 years to earn satisfactory credits to graduate. as the boke, suga is prone to strange comments, while ujihara is the more reasonable of the two, often criticizing suga's remarks. as their talk material, they often use current affairs and items that japanese students learn in high school and middle school. suga writes almost all their material while ujihara types them out since suga cannot touch-type. in yoshimoto kogyo's annual "most handsome yoshimoto kogyo entertainer" awards, suga won 7th place and ujihara won 14th in 2009 (8th and 20th in 2008 respectively).
