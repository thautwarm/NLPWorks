cyprian (latin: thaschus cæcilius cyprianus; c. 200 – september 14, 258 ad) was bishop of carthage and an important early christian writer, many of whose latin works are extant. he was born around the beginning of the 3rd century in north africa, perhaps at carthage, where he received a classical education. soon after converting to christianity, he became a bishop in 249. a controversial figure during his lifetime, his strong pastoral skills, firm conduct during the novatianist heresy and outbreak of the plague, and eventual martyrdom at carthage vindicated his reputation and proved his sanctity in the eyes of the church. his skillful latin rhetoric led to his being considered the pre-eminent latin writer of western christianity until jerome and augustine.
