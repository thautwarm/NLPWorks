capsaicin (/kæpˈseɪ.ᵻsɪn/ (inn); 8-methyl-n-vanillyl-6-nonenamide) is an active component of chili peppers, which are plants belonging to the genus capsicum. it is an irritant for mammals, including humans, and produces a sensation of burning in any tissue with which it comes into contact. capsaicin and several related compounds are called capsaicinoids and are produced as secondary metabolites by chili peppers, probably as deterrents against certain mammals and fungi. pure capsaicin is a volatile, hydrophobic, colorless, odorless, crystalline to waxy compound.
