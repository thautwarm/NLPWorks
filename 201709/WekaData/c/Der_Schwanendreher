paul hindemith's der schwanendreher (literally, "the swan turner") is a concerto for viola and orchestra. der schwanendreher occupies a place at the core of the viola concerto repertoire, along with the concertos by walton and bartók. it was composed in 1935 and premiered by the composer himself at a performance in amsterdam on 14 november 1935. each movement is based on a separate medieval german folk song, thus, it is sometimes referred to as the "concerto from old folk songs". this composition draws its title from the final movement's folk song base, "aren't you the swan turner?". the orchestra calls for 2 flutes (one doubling on piccolo), oboe, 2 clarinets, 2 bassoons, 3 horns, trumpet, trombone, timpani, harp, and a string section of 4 cellos and 3 double basses. this orchestration is uniquely interesting due to its lack of violins and violas which benefits the composition by making it easier for the solo viola to be heard. the movements are: 1.  
* "zwischen berg und tiefem tal": langsam – mäßig bewegt, mit kraft ("between mountain and deep valley": slow – moderately moving, with strength) 2.  
* "nun laube, lindlein laube": sehr ruhig – fugato: "der gutzgauch auf dem zaune sass" ("now grow leaves, little linden tree, grow leaves": very calm – fugato: "the cuckoo sat on the fence") 3.  
* variationen: "seid ihr nicht der schwanendreher": mäßig schnell (variations: "aren't you the swan turner?": moderately fast)
