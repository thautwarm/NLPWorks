the bradford canal was a 3.5-mile (5.6 km) english canal which ran from the leeds and liverpool canal at shipley into the centre of bradford. it opened in 1774, and was closed in 1866, when it was declared to be a public health hazard. four years later it reopened with a better water supply, and closed for the second time in 1922. it was subsequently filled in, although consideration has been given to restoring it. there are some remains, including a short section of canal at the junction and a pumping station building, which is now a dwelling.
