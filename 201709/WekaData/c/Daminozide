daminozide — also known as alar, kylar, b-nine, dmasa, sadh, or b 995 — is a plant growth regulator, a chemical sprayed on fruit to regulate their growth, make their harvest easier, and keep apples from falling off the trees before they are ripe. this makes sure they are red and firm for storage. alar was first approved for use in the u.s. in 1963, it was primarily used on apples until 1989 when it was voluntarily withdrawn by the manufacturer after the u.s. environmental protection agency proposed banning it based on concerns about cancer risks to consumers. it has been produced in the u.s. by the uniroyal chemical company, inc, (now integrated into the chemtura corporation) which registered daminozide for use on fruits intended for human consumption in 1963. in addition to apples and ornamentals, it was also registered for use on cherries, peaches, pears, concord grapes, tomato transplants and peanut vines. on fruit trees, daminozide affects flow-bud initiation, fruit-set maturity, fruit firmness and coloring, preharvest drop and market quality of fruit at harvest and during storage. in 1989, it became illegal to use daminozide on food crops in the us, but it is still allowed for use on non-food crops like ornamentals.
