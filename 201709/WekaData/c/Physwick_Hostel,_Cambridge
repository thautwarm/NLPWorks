physwick or fishwick hostel is a former constituent of the university of cambridge located on the south side of the present trinity great court. it was founded in 1393 when william fiswick (also known as fishwick or physwick), a bedel of the university, bequeathed his trinity lane hall to gonville hall (later gonville and caius college). chambers and lodgings were added by william revell, rector of titchwell, in his own benefice. members of the hostel and main hall were able to use these for pleasure or in sickness during recurrences of the black death plague. physwick was far more populous than the main college caius, usually between thirty and forty in number, but at one point over 80 commoner members at once, although it did not breed distinguished theologians, bishops and dignitaries. walter hart, bishop of norwich (1446–1472), maintained 12 students at physwick. it did however maintain a reputation for many years, educating many eminent and learned men, some of whom were summoned to fill honorable positions in the parent college, others to hold offices of state. physwick hostel features in several of susanna gregory's matthew bartholomew series books. in 1467 gonville hall also acquired st margaret's hostel and then in 1481 rebuilt the two as a single, substantial complex with hall and gate tower. in 1546 physwick and st margaret's were merged into the new trinity college by henry viii along with michaelhouse college, king’s hall and five other hostels: gregory’s, ovyng’s, catherine’s, garratt, and tyler’s.
