the jin dynasty, officially known as the great jin, lasted from 1115 to 1234 as one of the last dynasties in chinese history to predate the mongol invasion of china. its name is sometimes written as kin or jinn in english to differentiate it from an earlier jìn dynasty of china whose name is identically spelled using the latin alphabet. it is also sometimes called the "jurchen dynasty" or the "jurchen jin", because its founding emperor taizu of jin (reign 1115–1123) was of wanyan jurchen descent. the jin emerged from taizu's rebellion against the liao dynasty (907–1125), which held sway over northern china until the nascent jin drove the liao to the western regions, where they became known as the western liao. after vanquishing the liao, the jin launched an over hundred-year war against the song dynasty (960–1279), which was based in southern china. over the course of their rule, the jurchens of jin quickly adapted to chinese customs, and even fortified the great wall against the rising mongols. domestically, the jin oversaw a number of cultural and technological advancements, like the development of gunpowder and the revival of confucianism. in 1234 jin succumbed to the mongol expansion.
