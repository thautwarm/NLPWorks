purple is a color intermediate between red and blue. it is similar to violet, but unlike violet, which is a spectral color with its own wavelength on the visible spectrum of light, purple is a composite color made by combining red and blue. according to surveys in europe and the u.s., purple is the color most often associated with royalty, magic, mystery and piety. when combined with pink, it is associated with eroticism, femininity and seduction. purple was the color worn by roman magistrates; it became the imperial color worn by the rulers of the byzantine empire and the holy roman empire, and later by roman catholic bishops. similarly in japan, the color is traditionally associated with the emperor and aristocracy.
