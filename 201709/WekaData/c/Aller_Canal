the aller canal (german: allerkanal) is a canal built in the mid-19th century in the german state of lower saxony. the canal is 18 kilometres (11 mi) long and runs between wolfsburg and gifhorn. it was built to protect agricultural land from flooding by the river aller. the nearly straight canal carries water from the aller more quickly than the river itself can in its meandering course through this section of the old glacial valley.
