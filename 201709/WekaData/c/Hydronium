in chemistry, hydronium is the common name for the aqueous cation h3o+, the type of oxonium ion produced by protonation of water. it is the positive ion present when an arrhenius acid is dissolved in water, as arrhenius acid molecules in solution give up a proton (a positive hydrogen ion, h+) to the surrounding water molecules (h2o).
