the inferior gluteal nerve is the main motor neuron that innervates the gluteus maximus muscle. it is responsible for the movement of the gluteus maximus in activities requiring the hip to extend the thigh, such as climbing stairs. injury to this nerve is rare but often occurs as a complication of posterior approach to the hip during hip replacement. when damaged, one would develop gluteus maximus lurch, which is a gait abnormality which causes the individual to 'lurch' backwards to compensate lack in hip extension.
