kora (tibetan: སྐོར་ར, wylie: skor ra, thl: kor ra) is a transliteration of a tibetan word that means "circumambulation" or "revolution". kora is both a type of pilgrimage and a type of meditative practice in the tibetan buddhist or bon traditions. a kora is performed by the practitioner making a circumambulation around a sacred site or object, typically as a constituent part of a pilgrimage, ceremony, celebration or ritual. however, in broader terms, it is a term that is often used to refer to the entire pilgrimage experience in the tibetan regions.
