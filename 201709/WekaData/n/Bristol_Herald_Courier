the bristol herald courier is a 39,000 circulation daily newspaper owned by berkshire hathaway. the newspaper is located in bristol, virginia, a small city located in southwest virginia on the tennessee border. the herald courier is in what the media industry calls a converged newsroom, meaning its online (heraldcourier.com) print (herald courier) and broadcast (wjhl-johnson city) operations work together closely. herald courier reporters are trained to occasionally deliver webcasts of bristol news, conduct tv "talk-backs" with wjhl and gather audio for daily stories. news channel 11 reporters often have bylined stories that appear in the herald courier news pages. under media general, both operations provided content for tricities.com, a subsidiary of media general's digital media department. the future of the website is said to be up in the air. in 2010, the herald courier won the pulitzer prize for public service, the highest honor in american journalism, for "illuminating the murky mismanagement of natural-gas royalties owed to thousands of land owners in southwest virginia, spurring remedial action by state lawmakers."
