the sydney mechanics' school of arts (smsa) is the longest running school of arts (also known as a "mechanics' institute") and the oldest continuous lending library in australia. founded in 1833, the school counted many of the colony's educated elite as members, and quickly positioned itself as a centre for social change and intellectual life of the city of sydney with a program of public lectures, courses, lending library and other activities based on its mission of adult education. now in new premises, the smsa continues to offer public education programs and grants today. in 2011 the smsa opened the tom keneally centre, which holds the research collection of world-renowned author thomas keneally from his private collection and memorabilia.
