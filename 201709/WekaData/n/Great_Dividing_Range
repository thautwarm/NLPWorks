the great dividing range, or the eastern highlands, is australia's most substantial mountain range and the third longest land-based range in the world. the range stretches more than 3,500 kilometres (2,175 mi) from dauan island off the northeastern tip of queensland, running the entire length of the eastern coastline through new south wales, then into victoria and turning west, before finally fading into the central plain at the grampians in western victoria. the width of the range varies from about 160 km (100 mi) to over 300 km (190 mi). the sharp rise between the coastal lowlands and the eastern uplands has affected australia's climate, mainly due to orographic precipitation, and these areas of highest relief have revealed an impressive gorge country.
