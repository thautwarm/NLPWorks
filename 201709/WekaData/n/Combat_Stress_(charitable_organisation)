combat stress is a registered charity in the united kingdom offering residential and community treatment to former members of the british armed forces suffering from a range of mental health conditions including post traumatic stress disorder (ptsd). combat stress provides treatment for all veterans suffering with mental illness free of charge. on average it takes 13 years for a veteran to come to combat stress for treatment, however for those who served in iraq and afghanistan the time period is much lower. the charity was formed in 1919, as the ex-servicemen's welfare society, following world war i when the effects of shell shock were becoming known.
