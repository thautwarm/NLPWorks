atbash (hebrew: אתבש‎‎; also transliterated atbaš) is a simple substitution cipher originally used for the hebrew alphabet, but can be done to any known alphabet. it is considered 'complex', but, it has a possible key, and it is a simple mono-alphabetic substitution cipher. however, this may not have been an issue at the time when the cipher was first devised.
