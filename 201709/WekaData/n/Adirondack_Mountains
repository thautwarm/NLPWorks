the adirondack mountains /ædᵻˈrɒndæk/ form a massif in the northeast of upstate new york in the united states. its boundaries correspond to the boundaries of adirondack park. the mountains form a roughly circular dome, about 160 miles (260 km) in diameter and about 1 mile (1,600 m) high. the current relief owes much to glaciation.
