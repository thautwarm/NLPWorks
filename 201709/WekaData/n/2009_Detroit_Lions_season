the 2009 detroit lions season was the franchise’s eightieth season overall in the national football league. it was the first season with the lions for new head coach jim schwartz, and most of his new coaching staff. the lions also introduced slightly new uniforms and logos. the lions spent the whole season at the bottom of their division and finished at 2–14, the second-worst record during the 2009 season. pro football reference has argued that, owing to a weaker programme featuring the nfc west and afc north vis-à-vis their 2008 schedule against surprisingly strong nfc south and afc south divisions, the 2009 lions were actually a weaker team than the 0–16 2008 lions.
