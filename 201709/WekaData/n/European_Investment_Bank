the european investment bank (eib) is the european union's nonprofit long-term lending institution established in 1958 under the treaty of rome. as a "policy-driven bank" whose shareholders are the member states of the eu, the eib uses its financing operations to bring about european integration and social cohesion. it should not be confused with the european central bank. the eib is a publicly owned international financial institution and its shareholders are the eu member states. thus the member states set the bank's broad policy goals and oversee the two independent decision-making bodies—the board of governors and the board of directors. it is the world's largest international public lending institution. in 2009, caisse des dépots, cassa depositi e prestiti, kfw and european investment bank founded the long-term investors club.
