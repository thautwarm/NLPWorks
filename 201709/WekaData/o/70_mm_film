70 mm film (or 65 mm film) is a wide high-resolution film gauge for still and motion picture photography, with higher resolution than the standard 35 mm motion picture film format. as used in cameras, the film is 65 mm (2.6 in) wide. for projection, the original 65 mm film is printed on 70 mm (2.8 in) film. the additional 5 mm are for 4 magnetic strips holding six tracks of sound. although later 70 mm prints use digital sound encoding, the vast majority of existing and surviving 70 mm prints predate this technology. each frame is five perforations tall, with an aspect ratio of 2.20:1. the vast majority of cinemas are unable to handle 70 mm film, and so original 70 mm films are shown using either 35 mm prints in the regular cinemascope/â€‹panavision aspect ratio of 2.35:1, or, in later years, by means of digital projectors at these venues.
