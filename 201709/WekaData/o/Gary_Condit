gary adrian condit (born april 21, 1948) is a former politician and member of the democratic party who served in the house of representatives from 1989 to 2003. condit holds a b.b.a from the usc marshall school of business. condit originally represented california's 15th congressional district, and then later california's 18th congressional district after redistricting following the 1990 census. condit gained significant national attention for an extramarital affair with intern chandra levy, which was exposed after levy's disappearance in may 2001. condit was not candid and forthcoming with investigators about his relationship with levy, bringing him considerable negative attention and speculation that he was somehow involved in her murder. condit lost the 2002 democratic primary based in large part on negative publicity from the scandal. prosecutors later convicted an illegal immigrant and mara salvatrucha member, ingmar guandique, who had committed other assaults with similar characteristics. however, lacking physical evidence, the verdict was overturned and charges subsequently dropped by washington d.c. prosecutors after the testimony of a jailhouse informant was determined to be unreliable.
