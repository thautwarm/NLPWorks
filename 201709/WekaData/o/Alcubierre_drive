the alcubierre drive or alcubierre warp drive (or alcubierre metric, referring to metric tensor) is a speculative idea based on a solution of einstein's field equations in general relativity as proposed by theoretical physicist miguel alcubierre, by which a spacecraft could achieve apparent faster-than-light travel if a configurable energy-density field lower than that of vacuum (that is, negative mass) could be created. rather than exceeding the speed of light within a local reference frame, a spacecraft would traverse distances by contracting space in front of it and expanding space behind it, resulting in effective faster-than-light travel. objects cannot accelerate to the speed of light within normal spacetime; instead, the alcubierre drive shifts space around an object so that the object would arrive at its destination faster than light would in normal space. although the metric proposed by alcubierre is mathematically valid (in that the proposal is consistent with the einstein field equations), it may not be physically meaningful, in which case a drive will not be possible. even if it is physically meaningful, its possibility would not necessarily mean that a drive can be constructed. the proposed mechanism of the alcubierre drive implies a negative energy density and therefore requires exotic matter. so if exotic matter with the correct properties does not exist then the drive could not be constructed. however, at the close of his original paper alcubierre argued (following an argument developed by physicists analyzing traversable wormholes) that the casimir vacuum between parallel plates could fulfill the negative-energy requirement for the alcubierre drive. another possible issue is that, although the alcubierre metric is consistent with einstein's equations, general relativity does not incorporate quantum mechanics. some physicists have presented arguments to suggest that a theory of quantum gravity (which would incorporate both theories) would eliminate those solutions in general relativity that allow for backwards time travel (see the chronology protection conjecture) and thus make the alcubierre drive invalid.
