the  'ndràngheta (italian pronunciation: [(n)ˈdraŋɡeta]) is organized crime centered in calabria. despite not being as famous abroad as the sicilian mafia, and having been considered more rural than the neapolitan camorra and the apulian sacra corona unita, the 'ndrangheta became the most powerful crime syndicate in italy in the late 1990s and early 2000s. while commonly tied together with the sicilian mafia, the 'ndrangheta operates independently from them, though there is contact between the two, due to the geographical proximity and shared culture and language between calabria and sicily. a us diplomat estimated that the organization's narcotics trafficking, extortion and money laundering activities accounted for at least 3% of italy's gdp. since the 1950s, the organization has spread towards northern italy and worldwide. according to a 2013 "threat assessment on italian organised crime" of europol, the 'ndrangheta is among the richest and most powerful organised crime groups at a global level.
