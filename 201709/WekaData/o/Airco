the aircraft manufacturing company limited (airco) was a british aircraft manufacturer operating from 1912 to 1920. airco produced thousands of aircraft for the british military during the first world war, most of which were designed by their chief designer, geoffrey de havilland. advertised in 1918 as the largest aircraft company in the world, airco established the first airline in the united kingdom, aircraft transport and travel limited, as a subsidiary. a glut of war surplus aircraft and a lack of government interest in aviation caused the company to become unprofitable, and in 1920 it was sold to birmingham small arms company, who had its operations liquidated later that year.
