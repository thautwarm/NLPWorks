ad lib, inc. was a canadian manufacturer of sound cards and other computer equipment founded by martin prevel, a former professor of music and vice-dean of the music department at the universit√© laval. the company's best known product, the adlib music synthesizer card (almsc), or simply the adlib as it was called, was the first add-on sound card (on ibm compatibles) to achieve widespread game-developer acceptance, becoming the first de facto standard for audio reproduction. today the adlib's functionality can be recreated with emulators such as adplug and vdmsound (the latter is now deprecated but its source code has been incorporated into dosbox). emulating the adlib gold 1000 proves more of a challenge due to the surround sound module and the 2x oversampling effect.
