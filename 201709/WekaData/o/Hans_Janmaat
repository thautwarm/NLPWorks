johannes gerardus hendrikus "hans" janmaat (november 3, 1934 â€“ june 9, 2002) was a dutch politician of the centre party (cp) and later his own formed centre democrats (cd). he was parliamentary leader of the centre party in the house of representatives from september 16, 1982 until october 15, 1984 when he was expelled from the party. he later served as parliamentary leader of the centre democrats in the house of representatives from september 8, 1989 until may 19, 1998 when his party lost all its seats. although he was widely known, he was never a major force in the dutch political landscape, partly because of a cordon sanitaire imposed by the third lubbers cabinet.
