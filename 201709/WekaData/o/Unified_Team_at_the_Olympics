the unified team was the name used for the sports team of the former soviet union (except the baltic states) at the 1992 winter olympics in albertville and the 1992 summer olympics in barcelona. the ioc country code was eun, after the french name, équipe unifiée. the unified team was sometimes informally called the cis team (commonwealth of independent states), although georgia did not join the cis until 1993. during the winter olympics, the national olympic committees (nocs) of the constituent countries had not yet been affiliated to the ioc, so the olympic flag was used in place of a national flag at the opening ceremony and at medals ceremonies, and the olympic hymn was played for gold medallists. by the time of the summer olympics, the nocs had affiliated separately, though they fielded a joint team with a standard uniform as olympic qualifying rounds had been completed before the final demise of the soviet union. where an eun individual won a medal, the national flag of the medallist's nation was raised rather than the olympic flag, and a gold medallist's national anthem was played rather than the olympic hymn. the eun team continued to be represented at all ceremonies by the olympic flag and the olympic hymn.
