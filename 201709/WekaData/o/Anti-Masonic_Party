the anti-masonic party (also known as the anti-masonic movement) was the first "third party" in the united states. it strongly opposed freemasonry as a single-issue party, and later aspired to become a major party by expanding its platform and positions on other issues. after the negative views of freemasonry among a large segment of the public began to wane in the mid 1830s, most members of the anti-masonic party joined the whigs, the party most in line with its views on other issues. although lasting only a decade, the anti-masonic party introduced important innovations to american politics, such as nominating conventions and the adoption of party platforms.
