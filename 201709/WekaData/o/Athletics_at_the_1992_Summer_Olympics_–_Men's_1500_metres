these are the official results of the men's 1500 metres event at the 1992 summer olympics in barcelona, spain. there were a total number of 51 participating athletes, with four qualifying heats. most of the eyes were on reigning world champion noureddine morceli, who hovered in the middle of the pack, while joseph chesire led most of the race, marked by jens-peter herold through a slow race of 62.25 and 64.58 for the first two laps, setting up a fast finish. a step behind the leaders, as the pace quickened going into the final lap, home team favorite ferm√≠n cacho who had been strategically watching the field, pushed the final backstretch to move up on chesire. passing on the inside with just over 200 to go, cacho accelerated and was surprised chesire was not able to mount a challenge. charging out into a big lead around the turn, cacho kept looking back for the next challenger, but there was none, cacho and the spanish fans celebrated. even with his celebrating and looking back, cacho's last lap was about 50.5. mohamed suleiman edged past a fading chesire and a final sprint around the outside from eight place netted rachid el basir the silver.
