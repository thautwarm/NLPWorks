a congress is a formal meeting of the representatives of different nations, constituent states, independent organizations (such as trade unions), or groups. the term was chosen for the continental congress to emphasize the status of each colony represented there as a self-governing unit. subsequent to the use of congress by the u.s. legislature, the term has been adopted by many states within unions, and by unitary nation-states in the americas, to refer to their legislatures.
